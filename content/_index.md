# Biology Go
This site is a **digital Biology textbook**, created to support Malaysian students who are preparing for SPM and beyond.  
The goal is simple: make Biology content **clear, accessible, and exam-ready**, while also being engaging for modern learners.

## Why Digitize the Textbook?

- Traditional textbooks are **static and heavy**.  
- Students today need **quick navigation**, **searchable notes**, and **interactive references**.  
- Teachers need a **flexible resource** they can adapt to different learning levels, especially for students who struggle with the standard pace.  

## What Makes This Different?

- **Aligned with KSSM & SPM standards** â€” all scientific terms remain unchanged.  
- **Modular format** â€” topics are broken into short, focused sections.  
- **Designed for Gen Z attention spans** â€” clean layout, callouts, and visuals.  
- **Dual-language friendly** â€” content can switch between English and Malay.  

## Who Is Behind This?

I am a former **Biology teacher** with classroom experience (2018â€“2022) and a background in **conservation biology**.  
This project started from a simple goal: to help students who find Biology difficult by giving them a resource thatâ€™s easier to use than a printed textbook.
