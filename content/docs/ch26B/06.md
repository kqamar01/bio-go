# Conclusion: Linking It All Together <sub>[26A.6]</sub>

You now have the essential "bridge" connecting the molecules of life (DNA, RNA, proteins) to the observable patterns of inheritance.

Understanding the **central dogma** is the key that unlocks the chapters that follow:
-   **Chapter 26 (Inheritance):** You will see how the separation and combination of alleles (like in our card game) follow predictable patterns, known as Mendelian genetics
-   **Chapter 27 (Variation & Mutation):** You'll understand how changes in the DNA sequence (mutations) can alter proteins and create the variation we see in populations.
-   **Chapter 28 (Genetic Technology):** You'll discover how scientists can now directly manipulate this DNA → RNA → protein process to create genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and develop new medical treatments.
