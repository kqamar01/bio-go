# Experiment: Simulating Meiosis and Fertilization <sub>[26A.5]</sub>

## Research Question
How do the processes of meiosis and random fertilization create unique genetic combinations in offspring?

## Hypothesis
By randomly selecting one allele (card) from each parent and combining them, the offspring will have a genotype that is a unique combination of the parents' alleles.

## Materials
- Two standard decks of playing cards.

## Procedure Summary
This simulation is broken into two parts: simulating meiosis to create gametes (sex cells) and simulating fertilization to create an offspring.

### **Part 1: Meiosis (Creating Gametes)**
1.  **Represent Parents**: Each player takes one deck of cards (the "genome").
2.  **Isolate a Gene**: From your deck, find all four "Ace" cards. This is our target "gene."
3.  **Define Parent Genotype**: Each parent chooses two of their four Aces to represent their genotype. For example, Parent 1 has (Ace ♥, Ace ♠).
4.  **Simulate Segregation**: To simulate meiosis, each parent places their two Ace cards face down, shuffles them, and randomly picks **one** card. This single card is the "gamete"—it contains only one allele for the gene.

### **Part 2: Fertilization (Creating an Offspring)**
1.  **Combine Gametes**: Both parents reveal their chosen "gamete" card.
2.  **Determine Offspring Genotype**: Place the two cards together. This new pair is the offspring's genotype. For example, if Parent 1 contributed Ace ♥ and Parent 2 contributed Ace ♣, the offspring's genotype is (Ace ♥, Ace ♣).

## Interpreting the Results
- **Outcome**: The new pair of cards (genotype) represents a unique individual. For example, an offspring with (Ace ♥, Ace ♣) has a different genetic makeup than Parent 1 (Ace ♥, Ace ♠).
- **Conclusion**: This simple simulation demonstrates how **Mendel's Law of Segregation** (alleles separate during gamete formation) and **random fertilization** lead to genetic variation in the next generation.
