# The Process of Gene Expression <sub>[26A.3]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
The ultimate goal of the central dogma is to convert the genetic information stored in DNA into functional proteins, which are the molecules that carry out most of the work in our cells and determine our traits.

## The Breakdown
The flow of genetic information from DNA to protein is a two-step process known as the **Central Dogma of Life**.

### **Step 1: Transcription (Copying the Message)**
Inside the **nucleus**, a specific segment of the DNA (a gene) that codes for a protein is used as a template to create a complementary molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). This process is like making a working copy of a blueprint so the original can be kept safe. The enzyme RNA polymerase reads the DNA and assembles the mRNA molecule.

### **Step 2: Translation (Building the Protein)**
The newly created mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus and travels to the **cytoplasm**, where it attaches to a **ribosome**. The ribosome "reads" the mRNA sequence in three-base units called codons. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid, which is brought to the ribosome by transfer RNA (tRNA). The ribosome links these amino acids together in the correct order to form a polypeptide chain, which then folds into a functional protein.

âœ… **Quick Check**: If a DNA segment is transcribed, what type of molecule is created?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Link**: Many genetic diseases, like sickle-cell anaemia, are caused by a single error (mutation) in the DNA sequence. This small change gets transcribed into the mRNA and then translated into a faulty protein (haemoglobin), causing the entire disease.
