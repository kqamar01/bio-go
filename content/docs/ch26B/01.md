Before we dive into how genetic information flows, let's quickly review the main molecules involved from Chapter 4.

## **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)**

### **What is it?**
DNA is a double helix molecule that carries the complete set of genetic instructions for an organism's development, function, and reproduction[cite: 78, 79].

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Structure**: A double helix formed by two intertwined polynucleotide chains.
- **Components**: Each nucleotide consists of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T).
- **Location**: Found within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, organised into chromosomes.

### **Primary Functions**
- Acts as the **master blueprint** for all life processes.
- Carries hereditary information from one generation to the next.

## **RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)**

### **What is it?**
RNA is a single-stranded nucleic acid that plays a crucial role in converting the genetic information from DNA into proteins.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Structure**: A single polynucleotide chain, which is typically shorter than a DNA molecule.
- **Components**: Each nucleotide consists of a ribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Uracil (U).
- **Types**: Messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA) are the three main types involved in protein synthesis.

### **Primary Functions**
- Acts as a **messenger** to carry genetic code from the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm.
- Plays a key role in the synthesis of proteins.

## **Proteins**

### **What are they?**
Proteins are large, complex molecules composed of smaller units called amino acids, and they perform a vast array of functions within organisms.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Structure**: Polypeptide chains made of amino acid monomers linked by peptide bonds.
- **Composition**: Made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen; some also contain sulphur and phosphorus.

### **Primary Functions**
- **Building Blocks**: Form structures like keratin in skin and collagen in bones.
- **Enzymes**: Catalyse biochemical reactions.
- **Transport**: Like haemoglobin, which transports oxygen.
- **Hormones and Antibodies**: Essential for regulation and immunity.

âœ… **Quick Check**: What is the main structural difference between DNA and RNA?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: If DNA is the master cookbook of recipes safely stored in the library (nucleus), then RNA is a single recipe card you've written down to take to the kitchen (cytoplasm), and the protein is the final cake you bake from that recipe.
