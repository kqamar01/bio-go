# Introduction

So far, we have explored the basic building blocks of life.In **Chapter 2**, we learned about the **cell** and its components, including the **nucleus** where genetic material is stored. In **Chapter 4**, we delved into the **chemical composition** of the cell, discovering the structure of **DNA, RNA, and proteins**. Then, in **Chapter 6**, we saw how cells divide through **mitosis** and **meiosis**, ensuring that genetic information is passed on

Now, we will bridge the gap between these topics and the upcoming chapters on **Mendelian genetics (Chapter 26)**, **variation and mutation (Chapter 27)**, and **genetic engineering (Chapter 28)**. This chapter will introduce a core concept in biology that connects them all: the **Central Dogma of Life**.
