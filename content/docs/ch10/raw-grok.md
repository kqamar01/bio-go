# Necessity for Transport Systems in Multicellular Organisms <sub>[10.1.1]</sub>

## The Scenario (The 'If')
Living cells in complex multicellular organisms require essential substances such as oxygen and nutrients while expelling waste products like carbon dioxide and nitrogenous wastes, but the organisms have a large body mass resulting in a small total surface area to volume ratio (TSA/V) and greater distances between internal cells and the external environment.

## The Biological Mechanism (The 'How')
In unicellular organisms with small body mass and large TSA/V, substances exchange directly by diffusion with the external environment, but in multicellular organisms, the small TSA/V and far distances prevent efficient direct exchange, requiring an internal transportation system like the blood circulatory system in vertebrates to deliver essentials and remove wastes.

## The Result (The 'Then')
Without a transport system, cells in multicellular organisms cannot obtain necessary substances or expel wastes efficiently, leading to cellular dysfunction and organism death.

âœ… **Quick Check**: "What would happen if a multicellular organism relied solely on diffusion for substance exchange?"
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Application**: "In medicine, understanding TSA/V helps explain why large tumors develop their own blood vessels to sustain growth."
```

- Wastes: Carbon dioxide from respiration and nitrogenous wastes from metabolism.

## Primary Functions
- Deliver oxygen and nutrients to sustain cellular activities.
- Remove carbon dioxide and nitrogenous wastes to prevent toxicity.

- Flow: Directly contacts cells without enclosed vessels throughout.

## Primary Functions
- Transports nutrients and wastes by bathing cells directly.
- Allows substance exchange through diffusion in the haemocoel.

# The Process of Haemolymph Circulation in Insects <sub>[10.1.4-1]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
The goal is to transport nutrients and wastes by bathing body cells directly in haemolymph within an open system.

## The Breakdown
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: Heart Contraction
The heart, with openings called ostia along its length from anterior to posterior, contracts to pump haemolymph out into the haemocoel.
### Step 2: Substance Exchange
In the haemocoel, haemolymph bathes cells, allowing nutrient delivery and waste removal through diffusion.
### Step 3: Heart Relaxation
The heart relaxes, drawing haemolymph back through ostia.

# Effect of Conditions on Blood Pressure <sub>[10.3.2]</sub>

## The Scenario (The 'If')
Blood pressure changes due to physical activity, posture, or emotional states detected by baroreceptors in carotid arteries and aorta.

## The Biological Mechanism (The 'How')
Impulses from baroreceptors go to the cardiovascular center in the medulla oblongata, which adjusts via sympathetic (increase) or parasympathetic (decrease) nerves to alter heart rate and vessel constriction.

## The Result (The 'Then')
Blood pressure returns to normal, maintaining homeostasis.

# The Process of Blood Clotting <sub>[10.4.2]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
The goal is to prevent excessive bleeding through a series of chemical reactions at the injury site.

## The Breakdown
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: Prothrombin to Thrombin
Inactive prothrombin converts to active thrombin enzyme, initiated by thrombokinase from platelets, damaged cells, clotting factors, calcium, and vitamin K.
### Step 2: Fibrinogen to Fibrin
Thrombin catalyzes soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin.
### Step 3: Network Formation
Fibrin threads form a network trapping erythrocytes to seal the wound.

# Health Issues Related to Blood Clotting <sub>[10.4.3]</sub>

## What is it?
Health issues include thrombosis (clot formation in vessels), embolism (traveling clot), and haemophilia (clotting deficiency).

## Key Characteristics
- Thrombosis: From vessel damage or slow flow accumulating factors.
- Embolism: Clot (embolus) blocks small vessels.
- Haemophilia: Hereditary lack of clotting factors causing excessive bleeding.

## Primary Functions
- Normally, anticoagulants like heparin prevent clots in intact vessels.

## Key Characteristics
- Group A: Antigen A, anti-B antibody.
- Group B: Antigen B, anti-A antibody.
- Group AB: Antigens A and B, no antibodies.
- Group O: No antigens, anti-A and anti-B antibodies.

# Effect of Blood Group Incompatibility in Transfusion <sub>[10.5.2]</sub>

## The Scenario (The 'If')
A donor's blood is transfused to a recipient with mismatched ABO groups.

## The Biological Mechanism (The 'How')
Recipient antibodies react against donor antigens, causing red cell clumping (agglutination).

## The Result (The 'Then')
Agglutination can block vessels and cause death; compatibility ensures safe transfusion (e.g., O donates to all, AB receives from all).

# Rhesus Factor <sub>[10.5.3]</sub>

## What is it?
The Rhesus (Rh) factor is an antigen D on red blood cells.

## Key Characteristics
- Rh-positive: Has antigen D.
- Rh-negative: Lacks antigen D.

## Primary Functions
- Influences transfusion compatibility; Rh-negative produces anti-D if exposed to Rh-positive.

# Effect of Rhesus Mismatch in Pregnancy <sub>[10.5.4]</sub>

## The Scenario (The 'If')
An Rh-negative mother carries an Rh-positive fetus from an Rh-positive father.

## The Biological Mechanism (The 'How')
Fetal Rh-positive cells cross placenta late in pregnancy, prompting maternal anti-D production; antibodies cross back, but low in first pregnancy; persist for subsequent ones, destroying fetal red cells.

## The Result (The 'Then')
First child usually unaffected; subsequent Rh-positive fetuses risk erythroblastosis fetalis (anemia, retardation, death); preventable with anti-Rhesus globulins post-first birth.

# Effect of Unhealthy Habits on Circulatory Health <sub>[10.6.1]</sub>

## The Scenario (The 'If')
An individual engages in poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, or alcohol consumption.

Leads to cardiovascular diseases; healthy practices like balanced low-fat diet and exercise maintain optimum health.

# Cardiovascular Diseases <sub>[10.6.2]</sub>

## What is it?
Cardiovascular diseases affect heart and vessels, including atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, angina, hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke.

## Key Characteristics
- Atherosclerosis: Plaque (cholesterol, lipids, dead tissues, platelets) deposits narrow arteries.
- Arteriosclerosis: Calcium hardens plaque, reducing elasticity.
- Others: Hypertension from restricted flow; stroke from bursts or clots; angina from low oxygen to heart; infarction from blocked coronary.

## Primary Functions
- Plaque forms on walls, restricting blood, leading to dead cardiac muscle in infarctions.

# The Process of Tissue Fluid and Lymph Formation <sub>[10.7.1]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
The goal is to facilitate substance exchange between blood and cells while returning excess fluid.

## The Breakdown
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: High Pressure at Arterial End
Blood pressure forces plasma (without large components) out of capillaries into intercellular spaces, forming tissue fluid for nutrient/oxygen delivery and waste removal.
### Step 2: Reabsorption at Venule End
85% of fluid reabsorbs due to hypertonic plasma and lower pressure.
### Step 3: Lymph Formation
Remaining 15% enters lymphatic capillaries (closed at one end, with valves), becoming lymph.

## Abstract
This chapter explores transport systems in multicellular organisms, focusing on circulatory and lymphatic systems. It covers the necessity and types of circulatory systems (open and closed), comparisons across species (insects, fish, amphibians, humans), human blood composition, heart structure and function, heartbeat mechanism, blood clotting, blood groups (ABO and Rhesus), cardiovascular and lymphatic health issues, and the lymphatic system's role in fluid balance, fat transport, and defense.
