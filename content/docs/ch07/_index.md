* **Fundamental Concepts**: An overview of **cellular respiration** as the process of releasing energy by oxidizing organic molecules, with **glucose** being the main substrate. Explanations of **metabolism**, including **anabolism** (energy use) and **catabolism** (energy release).
* **Types of Respiration**:
    * **Aerobic Respiration**: Requires oxygen and has three stages: glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.
    * **Anaerobic Respiration and Fermentation**: Occur without oxygen. Anaerobic respiration has fewer stages than aerobic respiration, and fermentation is a simpler process that only involves glycolysis. Examples of products from fermentation are `tempe` and `tapai`.
* **Health and Respiration**: Discusses the health implications of abnormal cellular respiration, such as **muscle cramps** caused by the build-up of **lactic acid** from fermentation.
