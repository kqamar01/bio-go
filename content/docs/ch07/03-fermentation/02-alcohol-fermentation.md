# The Process of Alcohol Fermentation <sub>[7.3.2-1]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
Alcohol fermentation allows organisms to produce energy from glucose when oxygen is limited, generating ethanol and carbon dioxide as byproducts.

## The Breakdown
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: Glycolysis
Glucose is broken down into pyruvate molecules in the cytoplasm, just like in aerobic respiration.

### Step 2: Pyruvate Conversion
Without oxygen, pyruvate is converted into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide instead of entering the mitochondria.

### Step 3: Energy Release
This incomplete breakdown releases only 210 kJ of energy per glucose molecule, much less than aerobic respiration.

## Word Equation
**Glucose â†’ Ethanol + carbon dioxide + energy (210 kJ)**

## Examples in Nature and Industry

### **Yeast Plants**
- **Beer and wine production**: Yeast ferments sugars in grapes/grains to produce alcohol
- **Bread making**: COâ‚‚ produced makes dough rise, alcohol evaporates during baking

### **Paddy Plants**
- **Waterlogged adaptation**: Rice plants can survive in flooded fields using alcohol fermentation
- **Tolerance mechanism**: Produce alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes to break down toxic ethanol
- **Survival advantage**: Can continue energy production when roots lack oxygen

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why do rice plants need special enzymes to handle alcohol fermentation?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Link**: This is why rice can grow in flooded paddies where other crops would die - they've evolved to handle the toxic byproducts of their own fermentation process.
