# Experiment: Studying Yeast Fermentation Products <sub>[7.3.4]</sub>

## Research Question
What are the products of yeast fermentation and how can we detect them?

## Hypothesis
Yeast fermentation produces energy, carbon dioxide, and ethanol, which can be detected through temperature changes, lime water tests, and smell.

## Key Variables
- **Manipulated**: Presence of yeast (tube A has yeast, tube B does not)
- **Responding**: Temperature change, lime water color change, ethanol smell
- **Fixed**: Volume of glucose solution, anaerobic conditions, time duration

## Procedure Summary
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: Setup Preparation
Prepare two boiling tubes with cooled, boiled glucose solution. Add yeast suspension to tube A only, then add paraffin oil to both tubes to create anaerobic conditions.

### Step 2: Detection System
Connect delivery tubes from each boiling tube to test tubes containing lime water to detect COâ‚‚ production. Insert thermometers to monitor temperature changes.

### Step 3: Observation Period
Leave apparatus for 1 hour, then record temperature changes, lime water color changes, and smell of solutions.

## Interpreting the Results
- **Temperature increase in tube A**: Indicates energy release from fermentation
- **Lime water turns cloudy in tube A**: Confirms COâ‚‚ production
- **Ethanol smell in tube A**: Confirms alcohol production
- **No changes in tube B**: Confirms yeast is necessary for fermentation

## Key Experimental Controls
- **Boiled glucose solution**: Eliminates contaminating microorganisms
- **Paraffin oil layer**: Maintains anaerobic conditions for fermentation
- **Control tube B**: Proves changes are due to yeast activity
- **Lime water test**: Specific detection method for carbon dioxide

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Safety Note**: Ensure delivery tube ends are properly submerged in lime water. Work in well-ventilated area due to alcohol production.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why is it important to boil the glucose solution before the experiment?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Application**: This same fermentation process is used in commercial bread, beer, and wine production, where controlling oxygen levels determines the final products.
