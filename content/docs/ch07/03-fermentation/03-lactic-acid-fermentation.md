# The Process of Lactic Acid Fermentation <sub>[7.3.2-2]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
Lactic acid fermentation provides energy when oxygen supply is insufficient, producing lactic acid as the main byproduct instead of alcohol.

## The Breakdown
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: Glycolysis
Glucose is broken down into pyruvate molecules in the cytoplasm, producing some ATP.

### Step 2: Pyruvate to Lactic Acid
Without sufficient oxygen, pyruvate is converted directly into lactic acid rather than being fully oxidized.

### Step 3: Limited Energy Release
This process generates only 150 kJ of energy per glucose molecule and produces only 2 ATP molecules.
{{% /steps %}}

## Word Equation
**Glucose â†’ Lactic acid + energy (150 kJ)**

## Examples in Different Organisms

### **Human Muscle Cells**
- **Trigger condition**: During vigorous exercise when oxygen demand exceeds supply
- **Oxygen debt state**: Muscles cannot get enough oxygen from blood circulation
- **Consequence**: Lactic acid accumulates, causing muscle fatigue and cramps
- **Recovery**: Excess oxygen intake after exercise oxidizes lactic acid back to COâ‚‚ and water

### **Lactobacillus Bacteria**
- **Industrial application**: Used in yogurt production from milk
- **Process**: Bacteria convert lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid
- **Result**: Lactic acid coagulates casein (milk protein) and creates sour taste
- **Product**: Formation of yogurt with characteristic texture and flavor

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why do muscles cramp during intense exercise?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Link**: This is why athletes need "recovery time" after intense workouts - their bodies need extra oxygen to clear the lactic acid buildup and repay the "oxygen debt."
