# Fermentation: Energy Production Without Oxygen <sub>[7.3.1]</sub>

## What is it?
Fermentation is the incomplete breakdown of glucose in conditions of limited oxygen or without oxygen, providing an alternative pathway for energy production.

## Key Characteristics
- **Oxygen conditions**: Occurs in limited oxygen or anaerobic conditions
- **Incomplete breakdown**: Glucose is not fully oxidized
- **Alternative pathway**: Different metabolic route after glycolysis
- **Lower efficiency**: Produces less energy than aerobic respiration

## Primary Functions
- **Emergency energy source** when oxygen is limited
- **Survival mechanism** for organisms in anaerobic environments
- **Continuous energy production** without oxygen dependency
- **Metabolic flexibility** for changing environmental conditions

## Factors That Cause Fermentation
- **Limited oxygen availability** in the environment
- **High energy demand** exceeding oxygen supply rate
- **Anaerobic conditions** in tissues or environments
- **Waterlogged conditions** preventing normal gas exchange

## Types of Fermentation
- **Alcohol fermentation**: Produces ethanol and carbon dioxide
- **Lactic acid fermentation**: Produces lactic acid

âœ… **Quick Check**: When would a cell switch from aerobic respiration to fermentation?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Like a backup generator that kicks in during a power outage - fermentation provides energy when the main system (aerobic respiration) can't function due to lack of oxygen.
