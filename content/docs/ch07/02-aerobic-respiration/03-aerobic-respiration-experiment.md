# Experiment: Studying Aerobic Respiration with a Respirometer <sub>[7.2.3]</sub>

## Research Question
Do living organisms use oxygen and release carbon dioxide during aerobic respiration?

## Hypothesis
Living organisms use oxygen and release carbon dioxide during aerobic respiration, which can be measured by changes in gas volume.

## Key Variables
- **Manipulated**: Presence of living organisms (cockroach vs. empty tube)
- **Responding**: Change in level of coloured liquid in capillary tube
- **Fixed**: Initial liquid level, temperature (water bath), amount of soda lime

## Procedure Summary
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: Setup
Prepare two identical boiling tubes (A with cockroach, B empty control) with soda lime and sealed capillary tubes containing coloured liquid.

### Step 2: Measurement
Mark initial liquid levels in both capillary tubes and place apparatus in water bath to maintain constant temperature.

### Step 3: Observation
Leave for one hour, then measure final liquid levels. The respirometer measures oxygen consumption by volume changes.

## Interpreting the Results
- **Positive Result**: Rising liquid level in tube A indicates oxygen consumption by the living organism
- **Negative Result**: No change in tube B (control) confirms the effect is due to the organism
- **Soda lime function**: Absorbs COâ‚‚ produced, so volume changes reflect only oxygen use

## Expected Outcome
Tube A (with cockroach) shows rising liquid level due to oxygen consumption, while tube B (control) shows no change.

**Safety Note**: Ensure all connections are airtight with petroleum jelly. Handle living organisms gently and return them safely after the experiment.

ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Application**: Respirometers are used in medical settings to measure metabolic rates and in research to study how different factors affect cellular respiration rates.
