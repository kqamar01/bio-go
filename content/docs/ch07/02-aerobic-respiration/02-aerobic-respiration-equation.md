# Aerobic Respiration Word Equation <sub>[7.2.2]</sub>

## What is it?
The word equation for aerobic respiration summarizes the complete oxidation of glucose in the presence of oxygen to produce maximum energy yield.

## Key Characteristics
- **Complete oxidation**: Glucose is fully broken down
- **High energy yield**: Produces 2898 kJ per glucose molecule
- **Clean process**: Only produces carbon dioxide and water as waste
- **Oxygen requirement**: Requires continuous oxygen supply

## The Complete Word Equation
**Glucose + oxygen â†’ Carbon dioxide + water + energy (2898 kJ)**

## Energy Components
- **Energy yield**: 2898 kJ per glucose molecule
- **ATP production**: Large number of ATP molecules formed
- **Efficiency**: Most efficient form of cellular respiration
- **Universal equation**: Same for all organisms performing aerobic respiration

## Simplified Process Summary
1. **Glycolysis**: Glucose â†’ Pyruvate (in cytoplasm)
2. **Pyruvate Oxidation**: Pyruvate â†’ Carbon dioxide + water + energy (in mitochondria)

âœ… **Quick Check**: How much energy does one glucose molecule produce during aerobic respiration?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Like a complete combustion engine that burns fuel efficiently, leaving only exhaust (COâ‚‚) and water, while extracting maximum energy from the fuel (glucose).
