# Cellular Respiration Basics <sub>[7.1.1]</sub>

## What is it?
Cellular respiration is the oxidation process of organic molecules through several stages to release energy needed by all living cells.

## Key Characteristics
- **Purpose**: Generate energy required by all living cells
- **Process type**: Oxidation of organic molecules
- **Universal necessity**: Required by humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms
- **Energy conversion**: Chemical energy from molecules â†’ usable cellular energy

## Primary Functions
- **Release stored chemical energy** from organic molecules
- **Provide energy for anabolic processes** like protein formation
- **Supply ATP molecules** for cellular activities
- **Support metabolic reactions** in all living organisms

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why do all living cells need cellular respiration?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Like a power plant that burns fuel to generate electricity for a city, cellular respiration "burns" molecules to generate energy for cellular activities.
