# Glucose: The Main Substrate for Energy Production <sub>[7.1.2]</sub>

## What is it?
Glucose is the main substrate for cellular respiration - the primary organic molecule that cells oxidize to release chemical energy.

## Key Characteristics
- **Chemical nature**: Simple sugar (monosaccharide)
- **Energy storage**: Contains chemical energy in its molecular bonds
- **Universal fuel**: Used by humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms
- **Accessibility**: Readily available through different pathways in various organisms

## Primary Functions
- **Primary energy source** for cellular respiration
- **Chemical energy storage** in an easily accessible form
- **Universal substrate** across different types of organisms
- **Foundation molecule** for ATP production

## Sources of Glucose
- **Humans and animals**: Obtained through digestion of carbohydrates from food
- **Green plants**: Produced during photosynthesis using light energy trapped by chlorophyll
- **Storage forms**: Can be stored as starch (plants) or glycogen (animals)

ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Glucose is like gasoline for a car - it's the preferred fuel that provides the energy needed to keep the engine (cell) running efficiently.
