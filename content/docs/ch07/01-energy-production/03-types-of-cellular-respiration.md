# Types of Cellular Respiration <sub>[7.1.3]</sub>

## What is it?
Cellular respiration occurs in different forms depending on the availability of oxygen, each with distinct pathways and energy yields.

## Key Characteristics
- **Oxygen-dependent classification**: Based on presence or absence of oxygen
- **Energy yield variation**: Different amounts of ATP produced
- **Pathway differences**: Different metabolic routes after glucose breakdown
- **Environmental adaptation**: Allows organisms to survive in various conditions

## Types of Cellular Respiration

### **Aerobic Respiration**
- **Oxygen requirement**: Occurs in the presence of oxygen
- **Location**: Cytoplasm and mitochondria
- **Efficiency**: Complete glucose oxidation, high energy yield

### **Anaerobic Respiration**
- **Oxygen requirement**: Occurs in the absence of oxygen
- **Alternative pathway**: Uses other electron acceptors instead of oxygen
- **Efficiency**: Less efficient than aerobic respiration

### **Fermentation**
- **Oxygen requirement**: Limited oxygen or no oxygen conditions
- **Characteristic**: Incomplete breakdown of glucose
- **Types**: Alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation

âœ… **Quick Check**: What determines which type of cellular respiration occurs in a cell?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Like different cooking methods - you can bake with an oven (aerobic), use a slow cooker without air circulation (anaerobic), or ferment foods in sealed containers (fermentation).
