# Environmental Sustainability

Environmental sustainability ensures the demands of current needs are met without affecting the needs of future generations. It is an environmental condition that remains stable without any reduction or depletion of natural resources, with an assured quality of the surrounding environment, for a long period of time. This chapter explores the various threats to the environment and the importance of applying green technology and sustainable development to ensure a healthy and stable future for all.

# What is Environmental Sustainability? \<sub\>[25.1.1]\</sub\>

## What it is

**Environmental sustainability** is the principle of meeting current human needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is about ensuring the quality of the environment is not diminished and that natural resources are not depleted over time.

## Why it's important

The concept of environmental sustainability highlights the inherent conflict between the increasing demands of a growing human population and the need to conserve the natural world. It requires a long-term commitment to keeping the surrounding environment healthy and stable.

## How to practice it

Strategies to achieve environmental sustainability include a variety of actions, such as using recycle bins to reduce the consumption of non-renewable resources.

# Major Threats to the Environment \<sub\>[25.1.2]\</sub\>

The sustainability of the environment is threatened by numerous human activities. These actions can lead to a decline in environmental quality, disrupt ecosystems, and negatively impact all living organisms.

## Breakdown of Threats

The key threats to our environment include:

  * **Eutrophication**: The enrichment of water bodies with nutrients.
  * **Climate Change & Global Warming**: The long-term change in Earth's climate system, driven largely by human-caused increases in greenhouse gases.
  * **Deforestation**: The clearing of forests for other land uses, leading to habitat loss.
  * **Loss of Biodiversity**: The extinction of species, which destabilizes ecosystems.
  * **Pollution**: The introduction of harmful substances into the environment, including air, light, and sound pollution.
  * **Human Population Explosion**: The rapid increase in the number of humans, which places immense pressure on natural resources.

# Eutrophication \<sub\>[25.1.2]\</sub\>

## The Cause

**Eutrophication** is a process where a body of water becomes overly enriched with nutrients, leading to excessive growth of algae. This condition is often caused by the runoff of excessive nitrate and phosphate from agricultural fertilizers and other sources into rivers and lakes.

## The Effect

1.  **Algal Bloom**: The high concentration of nutrients stimulates the rapid growth of algae, which forms a dense layer on the water's surface.
2.  **Reduced Sunlight**: This layer of algae blocks sunlight from penetrating the water.
3.  **Oxygen Depletion**: Aquatic plants below the surface can no longer photosynthesize effectively due to the lack of light. This leads to a decrease in dissolved oxygen in the water.
4.  **Death of Aquatic Life**: The reduced oxygen levels cause aquatic plants and animals to die.
5.  **Decomposition & Further Depletion**: Decomposing bacteria thrive on the dead organisms. They use a significant amount of the remaining dissolved oxygen to break down the dead matter, leading to a severe depletion of oxygen in the water. This increases the **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)** and creates an environment where little or no life can be supported.
