# Protein Elements <sub>[4.3.1]</sub>

## NAME
**Proteins** - complex macromolecules essential for cellular structure and function

## CHARACTERISTICS
- Composed of **carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen** elements
- Most proteins also contain **sulfur and phosphorus**
- **Most complex** of the biological macromolecules
- **Polymer structure** made from amino acid monomers

## FUNCTION
- **Structural components** - form cellular frameworks
- **Enzymatic catalysis** - speed up biochemical reactions  
- **Transport molecules** - carry substances through body
- **Defense proteins** - antibodies protect against pathogens

{{< callout type="important" >}}
The presence of nitrogen distinguishes proteins from carbohydrates and lipids, making proteins the only major macromolecule containing nitrogen.
