# Peptide Bond Formation & Breakdown <sub>[4.3.3]</sub>

## NAME
**Peptide bond reactions** - condensation and hydrolysis reactions involving amino acids

## CHARACTERISTICS
- **Condensation** removes water to form peptide bonds
- **Hydrolysis** adds water to break peptide bonds
- **Reversible process** under appropriate enzyme conditions
- **Energy-requiring** formation, energy-releasing breakdown

## FUNCTION
- **Protein synthesis** - build new proteins through condensation
- **Protein digestion** - break down proteins through hydrolysis
- **Cellular recycling** - amino acids can be reused
- **Metabolic regulation** - control protein levels in cells
