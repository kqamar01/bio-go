# Water Molecule Properties <sub>[4.1.1]</sub>

## NAME
**Water (H‚ÇÇO)** - an inorganic compound consisting of hydrogen and oxygen elements

## CHARACTERISTICS
- **Polar molecule** - shared electrons attracted towards oxygen (more electronegative, Œ¥-)
- **Universal solvent** - polarity allows it to dissolve many substances
- **Cohesive force** - water molecules attach to each other through hydrogen bonds
- **Adhesive force** - water molecules attach to other surfaces

## FUNCTION
- **High specific heat capacity** (4.2 kJ kg‚Åª¬π ¬∞C‚Åª¬π)
- Requires 4.2 kJ of energy to raise 1 kg of water by 1¬∞C
- Absorbs large amounts of heat with small temperature increases
- **Hydrogen bonding** between molecules creates these unique properties

‚úÖ **Quick Check**: Why is water called a polar molecule?  
üí° **Real Example**: Ice floats because water molecules form organized hydrogen bond networks, making ice less dense than liquid water.
