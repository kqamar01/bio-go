# Disaccharides <sub>[4.2.2]</sub>

## NAME
**Disaccharides** - double sugars formed from two monosaccharide units

## CHARACTERISTICS
- Formed by **condensation reaction** between two monosaccharides
- **Water molecule removed** during formation
- Can be broken down by **hydrolysis** with water addition
- Some are reducing sugars, others are non-reducing

## FUNCTION
- **Energy storage** - easily transported and stored form of carbohydrates
- **Sweetening agents** - provide sweet taste in foods
- **Metabolic intermediates** - broken down to release monosaccharides
- **Structural components** - some serve as cell wall materials

## Common Examples
{{% steps %}}
### Sucrose (Non-reducing)
Table sugar from sugar cane and fruits. Glucose + Fructose.

### Maltose (Reducing)
Malt sugar from grains during digestion. Glucose + Glucose.

### Lactose (Reducing)  
Milk sugar found in dairy products. Glucose + Galactose.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar because its glycosidic bond involves both reducing ends of glucose and fructose.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Which disaccharide is found in milk?  
ðŸ’¡ **Real Example**: People with lactose intolerance lack the enzyme lactase needed to break down lactose into glucose and galactose.
