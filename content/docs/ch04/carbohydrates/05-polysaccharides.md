## NAME
**Polysaccharides** - complex carbohydrates made from many monosaccharide units

## CHARACTERISTICS
- **Sugar polymers** with hundreds to thousands of monomers
- **Large molecular size** makes them insoluble in water
- **No sweet taste** and do not crystallize
- **Non-reducing** due to their complex structure

## FUNCTION
- **Energy storage** - store glucose for later use
- **Structural support** - provide mechanical strength
- **Cell recognition** - involved in cellular identification
- **Metabolic regulation** - control glucose availability

## Important Examples

{{% steps %}}

### Starch
Energy storage in plants. Found in chloroplasts, grains, potatoes, legumes.

### Glycogen
Energy storage in animals. Stored in liver and muscle cells.

### Cellulose
Structural component of plant cell walls. Provides mechanical strength.

{{< callout >}}
Humans cannot digest cellulose because we lack the enzyme cellulase, unlike termites and ruminants.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why are polysaccharides insoluble in water?  
ðŸ’¡ **Real Example**: Marathon runners "carb-load" by eating pasta and bread to maximize glycogen storage in muscles before races.
