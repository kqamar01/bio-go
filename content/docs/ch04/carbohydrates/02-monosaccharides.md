# Monosaccharides <sub>[4.2.2]</sub>

## NAME
**Monosaccharides** - simple sugars that are the basic building blocks of carbohydrates

## CHARACTERISTICS
- **Carbohydrate monomers** - simplest carbohydrate units
- **Sweet taste** and can form crystals
- **Water soluble** due to polar hydroxyl groups
- **Reducing sugars** - have reducing power due to free carbonyl groups

## FUNCTION
- **Energy source** - directly used by cells for ATP production
- **Building blocks** - combine to form larger carbohydrates
- **Cell signaling** - involved in cellular recognition processes
- **Metabolic intermediates** - participate in biochemical pathways

## Common Examples
{{% steps %}}
### Glucose
Found in plants (rice, wheat) and fruits (grapes). Most common monosaccharide.

### Fructose  
Found in honey and sweet fruits. Sweetest natural sugar.

### Galactose
Found in milk. Combines with glucose to form lactose.

{{< callout type="important" >}}
All monosaccharides are reducing sugars because they can transfer hydrogen atoms to copper(II) sulphate in Benedict's solution.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why do all monosaccharides give a positive Benedict's test?  
ðŸ’¡ **Real Example**: Athletes consume glucose drinks during marathons because glucose can be rapidly absorbed and converted to energy by muscle cells.
