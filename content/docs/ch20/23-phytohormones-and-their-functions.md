# Phytohormones and Their Functions <sub>[20.2.1]</sub>
## What is it?
Phytohormones, also known as plant hormones, are chemical substances produced in small amounts that regulate growth, development, and responses to stimuli in plants.

## Key Characteristics
- Effective even at very low concentrations.
- Synthesized in specific plant tissues and transported to target organs via phloem.
- Coordinate responses since plants lack nervous and endocrine systems.

## Primary Functions
Phytohormones regulate key processes such as:
- Cell growth and elongation
- Seed germination
- Flowering and fruit development
- Leaf and fruit abscission
- Stress responses (e.g., drought)

### Example: Hormone Transport
Auxins are made in the shoot tips and move down to stimulate cell elongation in stems, coordinating directional growth in response to light or gravity.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why are phytohormones effective at low concentrations?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Phytohormones are like text messages in a plantâ€”they carry important instructions from one part to another without needing to be sent in large volumes.
