# Types of Responses in Plants <sub>[20.1.1]</sub>
## What is it?
Plants respond to environmental stimuli through two main types of responses: tropism and nastic movements, both of which help ensure survival and adaptation.

## Key Characteristics
- **Tropism responses** are growth-based, slow, and permanent, with the direction of growth dependent on the direction of the stimulus.
- **Nastic responses** are non-growth-based or involve reversible movement, are faster and more visible, and their direction is independent of the stimulus direction.

## Primary Functions
- **Tropism** allows plants to grow towards beneficial stimuli (like light and water) or away from harmful ones (like toxins), optimizing survival.
- **Nastic movements** help plants protect themselves from predators, reduce water loss, or maximize photosynthesis by quickly adjusting their structures.

### Example: Tropism vs. Nastic
A plant shoot bending toward a window is an example of tropism (specifically phototropism), while a mimosa plant folding its leaves when touched is an example of a nastic response (seismonasty).

âœ… **Quick Check**: What are the two main types of plant responses to stimuli?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Think of tropism like slowly steering a car toward a destinationâ€”itâ€™s a gradual, directional change. Nastic movement is like slamming the brakesâ€”itâ€™s fast and doesnâ€™t depend on where the threat is coming from.
