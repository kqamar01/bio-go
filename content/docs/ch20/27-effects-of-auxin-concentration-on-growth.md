# Effect of Auxin Concentration on Plant Growth <sub>[20.2.3]</sub>
## The Scenario (The 'If')
The concentration of auxin varies in different parts of the plant, particularly in shoots and roots, due to environmental stimuli like light or gravity.

## The Biological Mechanism (The 'How')
Auxin promotes cell elongation in shoots but inhibits it in roots. The sensitivity of cells to auxin differs between these tissues. In shoots, higher auxin levels stimulate growth, while in roots, even low levels can be inhibitory at high concentrations.

## The Result (The 'Then')
- In **shoots**, increasing auxin concentration (up to ~10 mg dm‚Åª¬≥) enhances cell elongation and growth.
- In **roots**, low auxin concentrations stimulate growth, but higher concentrations (e.g., 10 mg dm‚Åª¬≥ and above) suppress elongation, causing reduced or stunted growth.

### Example: Root Growth Inhibition
When a plant is treated with high levels of synthetic auxin (like in some herbicides), the roots stop growing, leading to plant death‚Äîthis is exploited in weed killers.

‚úÖ **Quick Check**: Why might a high concentration of auxin kill a weed?
üí° **Real-World Application**: Farmers use synthetic auxins as selective herbicides because they disrupt root growth in broadleaf weeds without harming grasses.
