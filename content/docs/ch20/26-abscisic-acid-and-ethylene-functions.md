# Abscisic Acid and Ethylene Functions <sub>[20.2.2]</sub>
## What is it?
Abscisic acid and ethylene are phytohormones that regulate stress responses, dormancy, and senescence in plants.

## Key Characteristics
- Abscisic acid is a growth inhibitor; ethylene is a gaseous hormone.
- Both play crucial roles in plant survival under stress and in fruit ripening.

## Primary Functions
**Abscisic Acid (ABA):**
- Inhibits plant growth and seed germination.
- Induces **seed dormancy** to survive harsh conditions.
- Stimulates **stomatal closure** during drought to reduce water loss.
- Promotes **abscission** of mature leaves, flowers, and fruits.

**Ethylene:**
- Stimulates **fruit ripening** (e.g., bananas, tomatoes).
- Promotes **senescence** (aging) of leaves and flowers.
- Triggers **abscission** of leaves and fruits.
- Used commercially to ripen fruit uniformly.

### Example: Ripening Fruit
Wrapping a banana in a plastic bag speeds up ripening because the ethylene gas it releases gets trapped and acts on the fruit.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why is abscisic acid important during drought?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Abscisic acid is like a plantâ€™s emergency brakeâ€”it slows everything down to survive tough times. Ethylene is like a ripening signalâ€”it tells fruit itâ€™s time to mature and be eaten (for seed dispersal).
