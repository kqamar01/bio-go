# Auxin Functions in Plant Growth <sub>[20.2.2]</sub>
## What is it?
Auxin is a key phytohormone that regulates various aspects of plant growth and development, particularly in response to environmental stimuli.

## Key Characteristics
- Synthesized in the apical meristem (shoot and root tips).
- Moves polarly (from tip downward) through the plant.
- Plays a central role in tropic responses.

## Primary Functions
- Stimulates **cell elongation** in shoots and roots.
- Controls **phototropism** and **geotropism** through uneven distribution.
- Promotes **apical dominance**, inhibiting lateral bud growth.
- Encourages formation of **adventitious roots** in stem cuttings.
- Inhibits **abscission** of young leaves and fruits.
- Stimulates **cell division** in the cambium during secondary growth.

### Example: Rooting Cuttings
Gardeners use rooting powders containing synthetic auxins to help plant cuttings develop roots faster, improving propagation success.

âœ… **Quick Check**: How does auxin prevent lateral buds from growing?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Auxin acts like a boss at the top of a companyâ€”it keeps control and prevents others (lateral buds) from taking over.
