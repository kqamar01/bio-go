# Gibberellin and Cytokinin Functions <sub>[20.2.2]</sub>
## What is it?
Gibberellin and cytokinin are phytohormones that regulate growth, development, and cellular processes in plants.

## Key Characteristics
- Both interact with auxin to balance growth and development.
- Cytokinin often opposes auxinâ€™s effects in apical dominance.

## Primary Functions
**Gibberellin:**
- Stimulates **stem elongation** and leaf expansion.
- Promotes **seed germination** and **flower development**.
- Induces **fruit growth** (e.g., larger grapes).
- Can restore **dwarf plants** to normal height.
- Inhibits root development.

**Cytokinin:**
- Stimulates **cell division** and **elongation** in roots and shoots (especially with auxin).
- Promotes **lateral bud growth** and inhibits apical dominance.
- Delays **leaf senescence** (aging).
- Used in **tissue culture** for organ formation.
- Enhances **seed germination**.

### Example: Delaying Wilting
Florists use cytokinin sprays on cut flowers to keep them fresh longer by slowing down leaf yellowing and death.

âœ… **Quick Check**: How do cytokinins and auxins work together in tissue culture?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Gibberellin is like a growth boosterâ€”it makes stems stretch tall. Cytokinin is like a team motivatorâ€”it encourages side branches to grow and keeps leaves green and active.
