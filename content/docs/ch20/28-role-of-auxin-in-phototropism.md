# Role of Auxin in Phototropism and Geotropism <sub>[20.2.4]</sub>
## The Scenario (The 'If')
A plant shoot is exposed to unilateral light, or a seedling is positioned horizontally, creating an uneven environmental stimulus.

## The Biological Mechanism (The 'How')
- In **phototropism**, auxin moves away from the light side to the shaded side of the shoot tip. This creates a higher concentration of auxin on the shaded side.
- In **geotropism**, gravity causes auxin to accumulate on the lower side of the shoot and root tips.

## The Result (The 'Then')
- In **shoots**: Higher auxin on the shaded or lower side stimulates faster cell elongation, causing the shoot to bend **toward light** (phototropism) or **upward** (geotropism).
- In **roots**: High auxin concentration on the lower side **inhibits** cell elongation, causing the root to bend **downward** in response to gravity.

### Example: Seedling Growth
When a seed germinates underground, its root grows downward and shoot upward due to gravity-induced auxin distribution, ensuring proper establishment.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why does a shoot bend toward light but a root bend away from it?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Application**: Understanding auxin helps farmers optimize plant spacing and lighting in greenhouses to promote even growth.
