# Tropism Responses in Plants <sub>[20.1.1]</sub>
## What is it?
Tropism is a directional growth response in plants triggered by an external stimulus, where the direction of growth depends on the direction of the stimulus.

## Key Characteristics
- The response is **slow** and **permanent**.
- It is influenced by plant hormones, especially auxins.
- Growth toward the stimulus is **positive tropism**; growth away is **negative tropism**.

## Types of Tropism
- **Phototropism**: Growth in response to light. Shoots show positive phototropism by growing toward light.
- **Geotropism (Gravitropism)**: Response to gravity. Roots grow downward (positive), shoots grow upward (negative).
- **Hydrotropism**: Growth toward water. Roots exhibit positive hydrotropism by growing toward moisture.
- **Thigmotropism**: Response to touch. Tendrils wrap around supports (positive thigmotropism).
- **Chemotropism**: Response to chemicals. Roots grow toward mineral salts (positive) and away from poisons (negative).

### Example: Directional Growth
When a plant on a windowsill bends toward the light, it is exhibiting phototropism. Similarly, roots grow downward into the soil due to gravity, showing positive geotropism.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why is tropism considered a permanent response?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Tropism is like a sunflower slowly turning its face to follow the sun throughout the dayâ€”each movement is small but adds up to a lasting change.
