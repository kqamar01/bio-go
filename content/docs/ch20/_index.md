# Responses in Plants <sub>[Chapter 20]</sub>

Plants exhibit dynamic and adaptive responses to environmental stimuli through physiological and structural changes mediated by internal signaling systems. These responses are essential for survival, growth, and reproduction in changing environments. This chapter explores two primary categories of plant responses: **tropism** and **nastic movements**. Tropisms are directional growth responses influenced by external cues such as light (phototropism), gravity (geotropism), water (hydrotropism), touch (thigmotropism), and chemical gradients (chemotropism). These slow, irreversible changes are primarily regulated by asymmetric distribution of the phytohormone **auxin**, which modulates cell elongation in shoots and roots.

In contrast, nastic responses are non-directional, reversible movements that occur rapidly in response to stimuli such as light intensity (photonasty), mechanical shock (seismonasty), temperature (thermonasty), or circadian rhythms (nyctinasty). Examples include the closing of mimosa leaves upon touch and the opening and closing of flowers in response to daily light cycles.

The chapter further examines the role of **phytohormones**—auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, and ethylene—as key regulators of plant development and stress responses. Each hormone has distinct functions: auxins coordinate tropic responses and apical dominance; gibberellins promote stem elongation and seed germination; cytokinins stimulate cell division and delay senescence; abscisic acid induces dormancy and stomatal closure during drought; and ethylene regulates fruit ripening and senescence.

Finally, the application of synthetic phytohormones in agriculture is discussed, including their use in promoting root formation, inducing parthenocarpy, controlling weed growth, and synchronizing fruit ripening. Understanding these response mechanisms provides critical insights into plant adaptability and supports advancements in crop management and biotechnology.
