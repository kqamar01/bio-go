# Comparing Haploid and Diploid Cells <sub>[6.1.2]</sub>

## What do they have in common?
Both haploid and diploid cells contain chromosomes that carry genetic information, but they differ in the number of chromosome sets they possess.

## Key Differences at a Glance
| Feature                | Haploid (n)                | Diploid (2n)                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Chromosome Sets** | One set of chromosomes | Two sets of chromosomes |
| **Human Example** | n = 23 chromosomes | 2n = 46 chromosomes |
| **Cell Type** | Gametes (sex cells) | Somatic cells (body cells) |
| **Formation Process** | Produced by meiosis | Produced by mitosis |
| **Function** | Sexual reproduction | Growth, repair, maintenance |

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why do gametes need to be haploid rather than diploid?
ðŸ’¡ **Why it Matters**: When two haploid gametes fuse during fertilization, they restore the diploid number, ensuring chromosome numbers remain constant across generations.
