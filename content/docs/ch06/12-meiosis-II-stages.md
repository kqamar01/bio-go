# The Process of Meiosis II <sub>[6.3.4-6.3.5]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
Meiosis II separates sister chromatids in each haploid cell from meiosis I, similar to mitosis but starting with haploid rather than diploid cells.

## The Breakdown

{{% steps %}}

### Step 1: Prophase II
Nuclear membranes disappear in both daughter cells. Chromosomes (still as sister chromatids) become visible. New spindle fibers form in each cell.
### Step 2: Metaphase II
Chromosomes align randomly at equatorial plane in each daughter cell. Spindle fibers attach to centromeres of sister chromatids.
### Step 3: Anaphase II
Centromeres divide, sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles. Each chromatid is now considered an individual chromosome.
### Step 4: Telophase II
Chromosomes reach poles, nuclear membranes reform. Spindle fibers disappear. Cytokinesis produces four haploid gametes from the original diploid cell.

âœ… **Quick Check**: How many cells result from one complete meiosis, and what is their chromosome condition?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Link**: In human males, all four cells from meiosis become functional sperm, but in females, only one becomes an egg while the others become polar bodies that eventually degenerate.
