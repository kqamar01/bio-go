* **Fundamental Concepts**: An overview of the two main types of cell division, **mitosis** and **meiosis**. Definitions of key terms like **haploid**, **diploid**, **chromatin**, and **homologous chromosomes**.
* **Mitosis**:
    * **Function**: A process that produces two identical daughter cells for growth, tissue repair, regeneration, and asexual reproduction.
    * **Process**: Explained through the **cell cycle**, which includes **interphase** (G1, S, and G2 phases) and the **M phase** (mitosis and cytokinesis).
    * **Abnormalities**: Uncontrolled mitosis can lead to **tumors** and **cancer**.
* **Meiosis**:
    * **Function**: A process that produces four genetically unique haploid gametes.
    * **Process**: Divided into two stages, **Meiosis I** and **Meiosis II**, with **crossing over** being a key event for genetic variation.
    * **Abnormalities**: Failure of chromosomes to separate (**nondisjunction**) can cause genetic disorders like **Down syndrome**.
