# Chromosome Terminology <sub>[6.1.2]</sub>

## What is it?
Key terms that describe the structure and organization of chromosomes within cells.

## Key Characteristics
- **Chromatin**: Chromosomes in their extended, thread-like form during interphase
- **Homologous chromosomes**: Pairs of chromosomes with similar structure and gene locations
- **Paternal chromosomes**: Chromosomes inherited from the male parent
- **Maternal chromosomes**: Chromosomes inherited from the female parent
- **Sister chromatids**: Two identical copies of a chromosome joined at the centromere

## Primary Functions
- Chromatin allows DNA to be accessed for transcription and replication
- Homologous pairs enable genetic recombination during meiosis
- Paternal and maternal chromosomes provide genetic diversity
- Sister chromatids ensure accurate distribution during cell division

ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Homologous chromosomes are like two different copies of the same book - they contain the same chapters (genes) but might have slightly different versions of the story.
