# Comparing Meiosis and Mitosis <sub>[6.3.6]</sub>

## What do they have in common?
Both are cell division processes involving chromosome duplication, spindle fiber formation, and nuclear division, but they serve different biological purposes.

## Key Differences at a Glance
| Feature                | Mitosis                | Meiosis                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Purpose** | Growth, repair, asexual reproduction | Sexual reproduction, gamete formation |
| **Number of Divisions** | One division | Two divisions (I and II) |
| **Number of Daughter Cells** | Two diploid cells | Four haploid cells |
| **Genetic Identity** | Genetically identical | Genetically unique |
| **Crossing Over** | Does not occur | Occurs in prophase I |
| **Chromosome Pairing** | No pairing | Homologs pair in prophase I |
| **Duration** | Relatively short | Longer, especially prophase I |

## Similarities
- Both involve DNA replication beforehand
- Both use spindle fibers for chromosome movement
- Both include prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase
- Both followed by cytokinesis

âœ… **Quick Check**: What is the main functional difference between mitosis and meiosis?
ðŸ’¡ **Why it Matters**: Understanding these differences explains why body cells maintain genetic consistency (mitosis) while reproductive cells create genetic diversity (meiosis) - both essential for multicellular life.
