# Meiosis <sub>[6.3.1-6.3.2]</sub>

## What is it?
Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that occurs in reproductive organs to produce gametes containing half the chromosome number (haploid) of the parent cells (diploid).

## Key Characteristics
- Reduces chromosome number from diploid (2n) to haploid (n)
- Involves two sequential division phases: meiosis I and meiosis II
- Produces four haploid cells from one diploid parent cell
- Includes genetic recombination through crossing over
- Only occurs in specialized reproductive cells

## Primary Functions
- Produce gametes (sperm and egg cells) for sexual reproduction
- Maintain consistent chromosome numbers across generations
- Generate genetic variation through recombination
- Enable fertilization to restore diploid condition

**Locations where meiosis occurs:**
- **Animals and Humans**: Testis (males) and ovary (females)
- **Plants**: Anthers (male) and ovules (female)

ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: If mitosis is like photocopying (making identical copies), then meiosis is like shuffling and dealing cards - creating unique combinations with half the original deck.
