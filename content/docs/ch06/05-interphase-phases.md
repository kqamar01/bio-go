# The Process of Interphase <sub>[6.2.1]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
Interphase prepares the cell for successful division by ensuring proper growth, DNA replication, and organelle production before entering mitosis.

## The Breakdown
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: G1 Phase (Gap 1)
Cell grows in size, produces organelles like mitochondria and ER, synthesizes proteins needed for replication. Nucleus appears large with chromatin visible.
### Step 2: S Phase (Synthesis)
DNA replication occurs, creating identical sister chromatids joined at centromeres. Each chromosome is duplicated but remains as one unit.
### Step 3: G2 Phase (Gap 2)
Continued cell growth and metabolic activity. Cell produces proteins required for chromosome condensation and spindle formation.

âœ… Quick Check: During which phase of interphase does DNA replication occur?
ðŸ’¡ Real-World Link: Many cancer treatments target S phase because rapidly dividing cancer cells are most vulnerable during DNA replication.
