# Comparing Cytokinesis in Animal and Plant Cells <sub>[6.2.4]</sub>

## What do they have in common?
Both animal and plant cells divide their cytoplasm after nuclear division to form two separate daughter cells, but they use different mechanisms due to structural differences.

## Key Differences at a Glance
| Feature                | Animal Cells                | Plant Cells                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Method** | Plasma membrane pinches inward | Cell plate forms at center |
| **Structure Involved** | Contractile ring of microfilaments | Vesicles fuse to form cell plate |
| **Direction** | Constriction from outside in | Growth from center outward |
| **End Result** | Two cells with flexible membranes | Two cells separated by rigid cell wall |

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why can't plant cells use the same cytokinesis method as animal cells?
ðŸ’¡ **Why it Matters**: The rigid cell wall in plants requires a fundamentally different approach to cell division, leading to the evolution of the cell plate mechanism.
