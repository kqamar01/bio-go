## What is it?
Cell division is the fundamental process by which a single parent cell divides to produce two or more daughter cells, involving two distinct but coordinated phases.

## Key Characteristics
- **Karyokinesis**: The division of the nucleus, where the genetic material is equally distributed
- **Cytokinesis**: The division of the cytoplasm, physically separating the cell contents
- Sequential process: Karyokinesis occurs first, followed immediately by cytokinesis
- Essential for growth, repair, and reproduction in all living organisms

## Primary Functions
- Replace dead or damaged cells in the body
- Enable growth and development of organisms
- Produce reproductive cells (gametes) for sexual reproduction
- Facilitate asexual reproduction in some organisms

âœ… **Quick Check**: What happens first during cell division - nuclear division or cytoplasmic division?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Think of cell division like moving to two new houses: first you divide all your belongings (karyokinesis), then you physically move to separate locations (cytokinesis).
