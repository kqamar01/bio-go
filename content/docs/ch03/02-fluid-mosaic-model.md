## What is it?
The structural elements that make up the plasma membrane according to the fluid mosaic model.

## Key Characteristics
- Phospholipid bilayer with hydrophilic heads facing extracellular fluid and cytoplasm, hydrophobic tails facing inward.
- Proteins embedded or attached, including channel proteins (form pores for ions and small molecules) and carrier proteins (bind and transport specific molecules).
- Glycoproteins and glycolipids (proteins and lipids with carbohydrate chains) act as receptors, stabilizers, and antigens.
- Cholesterol interspersed in the bilayer.

## Primary Functions
- Phospholipids form the basic barrier.
- Proteins facilitate transport.
- Glycoproteins and glycolipids enable cell recognition and stabilization.
- Cholesterol enhances strength, flexibility, and regulates permeability to water-soluble substances.

âœ… **Quick Check**: What are the main components of the plasma membrane?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: The plasma membrane is like a flexible mosaic wall with gates (proteins) and locks (cholesterol).
