## What is it?
The requirement for cells to exchange substances with their environment to sustain life processes.

## Key Characteristics
- Cells take in essential substances like nutrients and oxygen from the external environment.
- Cells eliminate waste products produced by metabolic processes.

## Primary Functions
- Maintains cellular homeostasis by regulating entry and exit of substances.
- Enables living processes such as respiration, nutrition, and excretion.
