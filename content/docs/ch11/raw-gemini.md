# Body Defence: Immunity, Antigen & Antibody <sub>[11.1.1]</sub>

## What is it?
**Immunity** is the bodyâ€™s ability to fight infections caused by pathogens or other foreign objects through specific attacks on the pathogens.

## Key Characteristics
- [cite_start]**Antigens** are foreign particles that enter the body and stimulate an immune response[cite: 1, 2]. They can be part of microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause diseases.
- [cite_start]**Antibodies** are proteins found on the surface of lymphocytes or released into the blood plasma[cite: 3]. They are produced by lymphocytes in response to antigens.
- [cite_start]The interaction between antibodies and antigens, which leads to the destruction of antigens, is called the **immune response**[cite: 4].

## Primary Functions
- [cite_start]**Antigens** stimulate lymphocytes to produce antibodies[cite: 3].
- **Antibodies** destroy antigens by binding to their specific antigen receptor sites.

âœ… **Quick Check**: "What is the key difference between an antigen and an antibody?"
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: "Think of an antigen as a key and an antibody as a lock. The antibody is specifically designed to fit and neutralize that particular antigen key."

# The Three Lines of Body Defence <sub>[11.1.2-1]</sub>

## What do they have in common?
The three lines of defence work together to protect the body against infectious diseases caused by pathogens.

## Key Differences at a Glance
| Feature | First Line of Defence | Second Line of Defence | Third Line of Defence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Specificity** | Not specific; it prevents all pathogens from entering the body. | Not specific; it responds to any infection. | Specific; lymphocytes produce antibodies that only combine with a certain type of antigen. |
| **Components** | Physical and chemical barriers like skin, mucous membranes, hydrochloric acid, lysozyme, sebum, sweat, and blood clotting. | Fever, phagocytosis, and inflammation. | Antibodies and memory cells produced by lymphocytes. |
| **Function** | To prevent pathogens from entering the body. | To destroy and neutralize pathogens that have successfully entered the body. | To provide a specific immune response and long-term protection against specific pathogens. |

âœ… **Quick Check**: "Why is the third line of defence considered 'specific'?"
ðŸ’¡ **Why it Matters**: "The three lines of defence represent a tiered defense strategy, much like a castle's defenses. The first line is the wall, the second is the guards who fight any intruder inside the gate, and the third is a specialized army trained to fight a specific enemy that has breached all other defenses."

# The First Line of Defence <sub>[11.1.2-2]</sub>

## What is it?
The first line of defence is a non-specific defense system consisting of physical and chemical barriers that prevent pathogens from entering the body.

## Key Characteristics
- **Physical Defences**: The skin is a tough barrier that is difficult for microorganisms to penetrate. The continuous shedding of dead cells from the skin also makes it difficult for microorganisms to grow. The blood clotting mechanism prevents bacteria from entering through wounds.
- [cite_start]**Chemical Defences**: The skin secretes sebum and sweat, which contain oil, acid, and lysozyme that prevent or break down the growth of microorganisms[cite: 1, 2]. [cite_start]Hydrochloric acid in the stomach destroys bacteria in food and drinks[cite: 3]. [cite_start]Lysozyme is also present in tears, nasal mucus, and saliva to destroy bacteria[cite: 4, 5]. The mucous membrane in the respiratory tract secretes mucus containing lysozyme to destroy bacteria in the air.

## Primary Functions
- To prevent pathogens from ever entering the body, serving as the first, non-specific barrier against infection.

âœ… **Quick Check**: "How does the skin act as both a physical and chemical defence?"
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: "The first line of defence is like a locked fortress with high walls (skin), a moat of acid (stomach acid), and guards that shoot arrows (lysozyme) at anyone trying to get in."

# The Second Line of Defence <sub>[11.1.2-3]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
The second line of defence, which is also non-specific, aims to fight against pathogens that have penetrated the first line of defence and to destroy harmful microorganisms and toxins at the early stages of infection.

## The Breakdown
The second line of defence consists of fever, phagocytosis, and inflammation.

{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: Fever
Fever is an increase in body temperature that increases phagocytic activity and fights against microorganisms.

### Step 2: Phagocytosis
This is a process where phagocytes (like neutrophils and monocytes) trap and digest microorganisms or dead cells. When an infection occurs, phagocytes move to the infected area. They extend finger-like projections called pseudopodia to envelop the pathogen, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. A lysosome containing the enzyme lysozyme then fuses with the phagosome to form a phagolysosome, where the pathogen is broken down and digested. The phagocyte then expels the remains of the digested microorganism out of the cell.

### Step 3: Inflammation
Inflammation is an immediate response to destroy and neutralize harmful actions of microorganisms. When tissue is damaged, it releases histamine, which causes blood capillaries to expand and become more permeable, allowing more blood, phagocytes, and clotting factors to flow to the infected area. The clotting mechanism is triggered, and phagocytes carry out phagocytosis. The inflamed area will typically swell, turn red, and feel painful.
{{% /steps %}}

âœ… **Quick Check**: "What are the two main types of phagocytes?"
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Link**: "The pus that can form in a serious infection is a combination of microorganisms, dead tissue fragments, and white blood cells (including phagocytes) that have been destroyed during the body's second line of defence."

# The Third Line of Defence <sub>[11.1.2-4]</sub>

## What is it?
The third line of defence is the specific immune response carried out by lymphocytes when pathogens overcome the second line of defence.

## Key Characteristics
- **Specificity**: Unlike the first two lines, this response is specific; each type of antibody can only combine with a certain type of antigen.
- **Lymphocytes**: These are cells formed in the lymph nodes that produce antibodies. T lymphocytes attack cells infected by pathogens and stimulate B lymphocytes to produce memory cells.
- **Memory Cells**: If the same pathogen attacks again, memory cells, which are lymphocytes that have "stored memories" of the pathogen, are stimulated to produce antibodies immediately.
- **Macrophages**: The lymph nodes also contain macrophages that destroy bacteria, dead tissues, and foreign particles through phagocytosis.

## Primary Functions
- **Antibody Production**: Lymphocytes produce antibodies to destroy antigens.
- **Long-Term Protection**: The stimulation of memory cells provides long-term immunity against specific diseases.

âœ… **Quick Check**: "How do memory cells help the body's immune system respond to a second infection from the same pathogen?"
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: "The third line of defence is like a specialised military intelligence unit. Once it has identified a specific enemy (antigen), it creates a specific weapon (antibody) to neutralize it and keeps a detailed file (memory cell) so that if the same enemy ever returns, it can deploy the weapon instantly."

# The Actions of Antibodies <sub>[11.2.1]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
Antibodies work to destroy antigens through five key mechanisms.

## The Breakdown
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: Neutralisation
Antibodies bind to and neutralize toxins produced by bacteria.

### Step 2: Agglutination
Antibodies link together multiple antigen-carrying pathogens, forming large clumps that are easier for phagocytes to trap and destroy.

### Step 3: Precipitation
Antibodies react with dissolved antigens to form an insoluble complex (precipitate) that is easily destroyed by phagocytes.

### Step 4: Opsonisation
Antibodies bind to antigens on a pathogen's surface, acting as a marker or "tag" for phagocytes to recognize and destroy the pathogen.

### Step 5: Lysis
Antibodies bind to antigens on a pathogen and cause the pathogen to undergo lysis, a process where it is broken down and decomposed.
{{% /steps %}}

âœ… **Quick Check**: "Which antibody action makes it easier for phagocytes to target and destroy pathogens?"
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Link**: "Agglutination is like using a rope to tie up a large group of enemies, making them unable to move freely and an easier target for the body's clean-up crew (phagocytes)."

# The Types of Immunity <sub>[11.3.1]</sub>

## What do they have in common?
Both active and passive immunity protect the body from infectious diseases and involve the interaction between antibodies and antigens.

## Key Differences at a Glance
| Feature | Active Immunity | Passive Immunity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Antibody Source** | The body's own lymphocytes produce the antibodies in response to antigens. | Antibodies are acquired from an external source. |
| **Duration** | The immunity is long-lasting, sometimes for a lifetime, due to the presence of memory cells. | The immunity is immediate but temporary and short-lived. |
| **When Acquired** | Naturally, after recovering from an infection, or artificially, through a vaccine injection. | Naturally, from a mother to a foetus via the placenta and through breast milk, or artificially, through an antiserum injection. |
| **Purpose** | To provide long-term protection against a specific disease. | To give immediate, temporary protection, often for treatment. |

âœ… **Quick Check**: "If you get a vaccine, which type of immunity are you developing and why?"
ðŸ’¡ **Why it Matters**: "Active immunity is like learning a skill yourself (e.g., self-defense), which takes time but you remember it permanently. Passive immunity is like being given a shield by someone else; it protects you right away, but you haven't learned the skill yourself, so it only lasts as long as the shield is with you."

# Health Issues Related to Immunity: AIDS <sub>[11.4.1]</sub>

## The Scenario (The 'If')
A person is infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HIV can be transmitted through body fluids such as blood and semen, or from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding.

## The Biological Mechanism (The 'How')
HIV attacks and progressively destroys the lymphocytes, which are the key cells of the immune system. Although an infected individual may not show symptoms for several years, the virus is actively attacking and spreading within these immune cells. This leads to a gradual weakening of the body's ability to fight off infections.

## The Result (The 'Then')
When the immune system is severely compromised, the individual develops Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). At this stage, the body is highly susceptible to various infections and diseases, and the immune system becomes paralyzed, which can eventually lead to death from other infections.

âœ… **Quick Check**: "Why can someone infected with HIV still not have symptoms for many years?"
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Application**: "This is why doctors use a combination of drugs in HIV treatment, as the virus can mutate and become highly resistant to a single drug. The drug cocktail targets the virus at multiple points in its life cycle."
