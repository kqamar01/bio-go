# Experiment: Studying Continuous Variation in Humans <sub>[27.2.2-1]</sub>

## Research Question
Do height and body weight show continuous variation patterns in a human population?

## Hypothesis
Height and body weight of students show continuous variation with most individuals clustering around average values.

## Key Variables
- **Manipulated**: Different individuals in the population
- **Responding**: Height measurements and body weight measurements
- **Fixed**: Measuring equipment, time of measurement, measurement technique

## Procedure Summary

{{% steps %}}

### Step 1: Data Collection
Measure and record height and body weight of each student in the class using standardized equipment.

### Step 2: Data Organization
Group measurements into ranges (e.g., height ranges of 135-139 cm, 140-144 cm, etc.).

### Step 3: Graph Construction
Plot the number of students against height ranges and weight ranges to create frequency distributions.

## Interpreting the Results
- **Bell-shaped curve**: Indicates continuous variation with most individuals having intermediate values
- **Normal distribution**: Confirms that the trait shows continuous variation influenced by multiple genes
- **Few extremes**: Very tall/short or very heavy/light individuals are rare

## Expected Outcome
Both height and weight should show normal distribution patterns typical of continuous variation, with most students falling in the middle ranges and fewer at the extremes.
