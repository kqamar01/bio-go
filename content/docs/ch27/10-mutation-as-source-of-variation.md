## What is it?
Mutation is a permanent change that occurs spontaneously in genes or chromosomes, creating entirely new genotypes.

## Key Characteristics
- Occurs randomly and spontaneously
- Creates completely new genetic variants not present in parents
- Can affect single genes or entire chromosomes
- Provides raw material for evolution
- Can occur in somatic cells or gametes

## Primary Functions
- Introduces novel genetic material into populations
- Provides the ultimate source of all genetic variation
- Enables species to potentially adapt to future environmental changes
- Creates genetic diversity beyond what sexual reproduction alone can provide

## Inheritance Patterns
- **Germ cell mutations**: Occur in reproductive cells (sperm or eggs) and can be inherited by offspring
- **Somatic cell mutations**: Occur in body cells and affect only the individual, cannot be inherited

## Examples
The CCR5 gene mutation prevents HIV from entering human cells by altering the cell surface receptor that the virus uses for infection. This beneficial mutation was discovered in an AIDS patient who recovered after receiving bone marrow from a donor with this mutation.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why can only mutations in gametes be passed to the next generation?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Mutation is like a typing error that accidentally creates a new word - sometimes it's meaningless, sometimes harmful, but occasionally it might be useful.
