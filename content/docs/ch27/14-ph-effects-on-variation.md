## The Scenario (The 'If')
Hydrangea plants with identical genetics are grown in soils with different pH levels - some in acidic conditions, others in alkaline conditions.

## The Biological Mechanism (The 'How')
Soil pH affects the availability of aluminum ions in the soil. The plant's flower pigment production depends on aluminum availability:
- **Acidic soil (pH < 5.5)**: High aluminum availability allows production of blue pigments
- **Alkaline soil (pH > 7.0)**: Low aluminum availability results in pink pigment production

## The Result (The 'Then')
Genetically identical Hydrangea plants produce dramatically different flower colors:
- **Blue flowers** in acidic soil
- **Pink flowers** in alkaline soil

## The Genetic Constant
The plants have identical genes for flower pigmentation, but the environmental pH determines which pigments can actually be produced, demonstrating how environment modifies gene expression.

## Practical Application
Gardeners can deliberately change Hydrangea flower colors by modifying soil pH through fertilizers or soil amendments, proving that the variation is environmentally controlled rather than genetically determined.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Is the flower color of all plants influenced by soil pH?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Application**: This principle applies to many agricultural crops where soil chemistry affects nutritional content, flavor, and appearance - explaining why the same grape variety can produce wines with different characteristics when grown in different regions.
