## What's the Goal?
Independent assortment ensures that chromosomes from maternal and paternal origins are randomly distributed to gametes, creating genetic diversity.

## The Breakdown

{{% steps %}}

### Step 1: Random Alignment
During metaphase I of meiosis, homologous chromosome pairs align randomly on the cell's equatorial plane.

### Step 2: Multiple Arrangements
Each homologous pair can orient in two different ways, independent of how other pairs align.

### Step 3: Chromosome Separation
During anaphase I, chromosomes separate according to their random alignment.

### Step 4: Diverse Gametes
Different combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes end up in each gamete.

## The Mathematical Reality
For a diploid cell with 2n=4 chromosomes (2 pairs), there are 2Â² = 4 possible chromosome combinations in the gametes. Humans with 23 chromosome pairs can produce 2Â²Â³ = over 8 million different chromosome combinations!

## Example
In a cell with two chromosome pairs, one gamete might receive both maternal chromosomes, another might receive both paternal chromosomes, and others might receive mixed combinations.
