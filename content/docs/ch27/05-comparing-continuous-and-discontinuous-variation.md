## What do they have in common?
Both types of variation show differences in characteristics among individuals of the same species, contributing to genetic diversity within populations.

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature | Continuous Variation | Discontinuous Variation |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Graph Type** | Normal distribution (bell curve) | Discrete bars (bar chart) |
| **Genetic Control** | Controlled by many genes | Controlled by single gene |
| **Intermediate Forms** | Present - gradual changes | Absent - distinct categories |
| **Environmental Influence** | Influenced by environment | Not influenced by environment |
| **Differences** | No obvious distinct differences | Obvious and distinct differences |
| **Measurement** | Quantitative (can be measured) | Qualitative (cannot be measured) |
| **Examples** | Height, weight, skin color | Blood type, tongue rolling, eye color |

## Inheritance Patterns
**Continuous variation** involves multiple genes working together (polygenic inheritance), while **discontinuous variation** typically involves simple Mendelian inheritance patterns with dominant and recessive alleles.
