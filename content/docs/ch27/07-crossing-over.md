## What's the Goal?
Crossing over creates new combinations of genes by exchanging genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis.

## The Breakdown
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: Chromosome Pairing
During prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up and come into close contact.

### Step 2: Chiasma Formation
Non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes form connections called chiasmata at specific points.

### Step 3: Genetic Exchange
Segments of non-sister chromatids break and exchange genetic material at the chiasma points.

### Step 4: New Combinations
Sister chromatids that separate during anaphase II now carry different genetic combinations than the original chromosomes.

## The Result
Gametes formed at the end of meiosis contain new combinations of genes that were not present in either parent chromosome. This recombination produces genetic diversity in offspring.

## Example
If a chromosome originally carried genes A-B together and another carried genes a-b together, crossing over might produce new combinations like A-b and a-B in the resulting gametes.
