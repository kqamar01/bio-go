## What's the Goal?
Genetic factors create variation by producing different combinations of genetic material in gametes, ensuring that offspring differ genetically from their parents and each other.

## The Four Main Mechanisms

### 1. Crossing Over
- Exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids during meiosis
- Creates new combinations of genes on chromosomes

### 2. Independent Assortment of Chromosomes
- Random arrangement of homologous chromosomes during meiosis
- Produces gametes with different chromosome combinations

### 3. Random Fertilization
- Any sperm can fertilize any egg
- Creates zygotes with unique genetic combinations

### 4. Mutation
- Spontaneous changes in genetic material
- Produces entirely new genetic variants

## The Outcome
These genetic factors primarily cause **discontinuous variation** because they involve actual changes to genetic material (genotype), creating distinct categories of traits that can be inherited by offspring.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Which genetic factor can create completely new traits never seen in the parents?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Link**: These mechanisms explain why siblings (except identical twins) look different despite having the same parents.
