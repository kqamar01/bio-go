## What do they have in common?
Both dominant and recessive traits contribute to human genetic diversity and follow Mendelian inheritance patterns, with specific allele combinations determining which trait is expressed.

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Characteristic | Dominant Trait | Recessive Trait |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Height** | Tall | Short |
| **Hair Type** | Curly hair | Straight hair |
| **Hand Preference** | Right-handed | Left-handed |
| **Dimples** | Present | Absent |
| **Tongue Rolling** | Can roll tongue | Cannot roll tongue |
| **Earlobe Type** | Free earlobes | Attached earlobes |

## Expression Patterns
- **Dominant traits**: Expressed when individual has at least one dominant allele (AA or Aa genotypes)
- **Recessive traits**: Only expressed when individual has two recessive alleles (aa genotype)

## Population Frequency
Dominant traits are generally more common in populations because they can be expressed in heterozygous individuals, while recessive traits require both parents to carry the recessive allele.

## Examples in Action
- **Free vs. Attached Earlobes**: Free earlobes are dominant, so most people have free earlobes
- **Tongue Rolling**: The ability to roll one's tongue is dominant, making non-rollers the minority
- **Dimples**: Present dimples are dominant over absent dimples

âœ… **Quick Check**: If both parents can roll their tongues, can they have children who cannot?
ðŸ’¡ **Why it Matters**: Understanding dominant and recessive inheritance helps genetic counselors predict the likelihood of inherited conditions and helps families understand trait inheritance patterns.
