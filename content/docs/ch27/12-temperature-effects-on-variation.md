# Temperature Effects on Variation <sub>[27.1.5-7]</sub>

## The Scenario (The 'If')
An organism with temperature-sensitive genetic traits is exposed to different temperature conditions during development.

## The Biological Mechanism (The 'How')
Some genes produce enzymes that only function properly within specific temperature ranges. When temperatures fall outside these ranges, the enzymes become inactive or produce different products.

## The Result (The 'Then')
The organism develops different phenotypic characteristics in different body regions or environmental conditions, creating visible variation patterns.

## Classic Example: Siamese Cats
Siamese cats inherit a gene for dark pigment enzyme that only functions at temperatures below normal body temperature. This temperature sensitivity creates a distinctive pattern:

- **Cooler body parts** (ears, face, tail, paws): Dark coloration due to active enzyme
- **Warmer body parts** (torso, back): Light coloration due to inactive enzyme

## The Genetic Basis
The cat has the same genotype throughout its body, but environmental temperature determines where the dark pigment is produced, creating the characteristic "pointed" coloration pattern.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why don't Siamese cats have dark fur all over their bodies?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Application**: This same principle affects many organisms - some reptiles and fish use temperature-dependent sex determination, where egg incubation temperature determines whether offspring become male or female.
