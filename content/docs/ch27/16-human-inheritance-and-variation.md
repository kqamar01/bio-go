## What is it?
Human inheritance involves the transmission of genetic traits from parents to offspring through dominant and recessive alleles, creating observable variation in human populations.

## Key Characteristics
- Each trait is controlled by a pair of alleles
- Alleles can be either dominant or recessive
- Dominant traits appear when at least one dominant allele is present
- Recessive traits only appear when both alleles are recessive
- This genetic information creates the variation we observe in humans

## Primary Functions
- Maintains genetic diversity within human populations
- Enables adaptation to different environments
- Provides material for natural selection
- Ensures species survival through genetic variation

## Inheritance Patterns
- **Dominant expression**: Occurs with dominant-dominant or dominant-recessive combinations
- **Recessive expression**: Only occurs with recessive-recessive combinations
- **Phenotypic ratios**: Follow predictable Mendelian patterns in populations

## Observable Variation
Human genetic variation manifests in numerous ways, from obvious physical differences like height and hair color to less visible traits like blood type and disease resistance.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why do children sometimes look different from both parents?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Human inheritance is like mixing paint colors - you get the basic colors from your parents, but the final shade depends on which specific combination you inherit.
