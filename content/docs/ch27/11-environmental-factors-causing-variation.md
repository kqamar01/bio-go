## The Scenario (The 'If')
Organisms with identical genotypes are exposed to different environmental conditions such as varying temperatures, light levels, or pH conditions.

## The Biological Mechanism (The 'How')
Environmental factors can influence how genes are expressed, affecting the phenotype without changing the underlying genotype. These factors can alter enzyme activity, protein structure, or metabolic processes.

## The Result (The 'Then')
Organisms develop different physical characteristics (phenotypes) despite having identical genetic material. This creates **environmental variation** that affects appearance but cannot be inherited by offspring.

## Key Characteristics of Environmental Variation
- Only affects phenotype, not genotype
- Cannot be inherited by next generation
- Effect is usually smaller than genetic variation
- Can change allele frequency in populations
- Primarily causes continuous variation

## Important Limitation
Environmental factors can change how frequently certain alleles appear in a population, but they cannot change the actual genotype of an individual organism.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why can't environmentally-induced changes be passed to offspring?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Application**: This principle explains why learned behaviors and acquired characteristics (like muscle mass from exercise) are not inherited by children.
