## What's the Goal?
Environmental factors interact with genetic factors to determine final phenotypes, where genetics provides the potential and environment determines the actual expression.

## The Breakdown

{{% steps %}}

### Step 1: Genetic Foundation
Individuals inherit genetic potential from parents (e.g., genes for height, intelligence, or disease susceptibility).

### Step 2: Environmental Influence
Environmental factors interact with these genes during development and throughout life.

### Step 3: Phenotype Expression
The final observable characteristics result from the interaction between genetic potential and environmental conditions.

### Step 4: Individual Variation
Even genetically similar individuals can show different phenotypes due to different environmental experiences.

## Classic Example: Identical Twins Study
Two identical twins (J and K) with the same genetic composition for obesity are separated and raised in different environments:

- **Twin J**: Low-fat diet, regular physical activity â†’ Ideal body weight
- **Twin K**: High-fat diet, sedentary lifestyle â†’ Obesity

**Conclusion**: Identical genotypes produced different phenotypes due to environmental differences in diet and exercise.

## Commonly Affected Traits
- **Height**: Genetic potential modified by nutrition and health
- **Intelligence**: Genetic capacity influenced by education and stimulation  
- **Skin color**: Genetic baseline modified by sun exposure

âœ… **Quick Check**: Can identical twins have different final adult heights?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Link**: This interaction explains why genetic counseling considers both family history and lifestyle factors when assessing disease risks.
