## The Scenario (The 'If')
Human skin is exposed to varying levels of sunlight over extended periods, particularly ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

## The Biological Mechanism (The 'How')
UV radiation in sunlight destroys melanin pigment in exposed skin. In response to this damage, skin cells increase melanin production as a protective mechanism against further UV damage.

## The Result (The 'Then')
People who spend long periods in the sun develop darker, tanned skin compared to those who remain indoors or use sun protection.

## Example: Occupational Variation
Construction workers, farmers, and other outdoor workers typically develop darker skin on exposed body parts (face, arms, hands) while maintaining lighter skin on covered areas. This creates visible variation within the same individual.

## The Protective Response
The increased melanin production serves as the body's natural sunscreen, absorbing UV radiation and protecting deeper skin layers from DNA damage that could lead to skin cancer.

## Reversibility
Unlike genetic variation, light-induced skin changes are temporary. When sun exposure decreases, melanin production reduces, and skin gradually returns to its baseline coloration.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why do people have tan lines after spending time in the sun?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Application**: This mechanism explains why people living at different latitudes evolved different baseline skin pigmentation - it's an adaptation to varying UV exposure levels throughout human evolutionary history.
