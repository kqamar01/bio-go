## The Scenario (The 'If')
A species exists in an environment that can change over time, presenting new challenges such as climate shifts, predators, or resource availability.

## The Biological Mechanism (The 'How')
**Natural selection** acts as an evolutionary force that selects beneficial genes and removes non-beneficial ones from the natural environment. Individuals with variations that provide survival advantages are more likely to reproduce and pass on their traits.

## The Result (The 'Then')
Species that possess phenotypes enabling them to adapt to their surroundings continue to live and breed, ensuring species survival. Those without advantageous variations may not survive environmental changes.

## Real-World Example
During the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom, environmental pollution darkened tree trunks. The darker-colored *Biston betularia* moths survived better than light-colored ones because they were camouflaged against the polluted background and less visible to bird predators.

âœ… **Quick Check**: What would happen to a species with no variation if their environment suddenly changed?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Application**: This principle explains antibiotic resistance in bacteria - varied bacterial populations contain some individuals that can survive antibiotic treatment.
