## What is it?
Variation refers to the differences in characteristics found within the same population or species.

## Key Characteristics
- No two organisms are exactly the same, even identical twins show differences
- Involves physical characteristics observed in phenotypic differences
- Caused by changes in structure, physiology, and biochemistry
- Enables identification of individuals within a population

## Primary Functions
- Forms the basis for evolution and natural selection
- Allows species adaptation to environmental changes
- Enables cross-breeding among species to form new species
- Provides raw material for beneficial trait selection

## Examples
Even identical twins, who share nearly identical genetic makeup, display observable differences in their physical characteristics, behavior, and responses to environmental factors.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why can we tell identical twins apart despite their genetic similarity?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Think of variation like fingerprints - even though all humans have the same basic hand structure, each person's fingerprint pattern is unique and allows for individual identification.
