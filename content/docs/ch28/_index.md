# Chapter 28: Genetic Technology

## Abstract

This chapter explores the revolutionary field of genetic technology, encompassing both genetic engineering and biotechnology applications that have transformed modern life. Students will examine how scientists manipulate genetic material to create genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and produce beneficial products like insulin, while understanding the ethical considerations surrounding these technologies.

## Learning Standards

By the end of this chapter, students should be able to:
- **28.1.1**: Describe the terms genetic engineering and genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
- **28.1.2**: Explain the application of genetic engineering in producing GMOs, genetically modified foods (GMF), and medical products like insulin
- **28.2.1**: Explain the meaning of biotechnology and its color-coded classification system
- **28.2.2**: Describe biotechnology applications including gene therapy, DNA profiling, pest control, and environmental cleanup
- **28.2.3**: Justify the importance of biotechnology in improving human life
