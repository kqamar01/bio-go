# Genetic Engineering <sub>[28.1.1]</sub>

## What is it?
Genetic engineering is a gene manipulation technique to modify an organism's genetic material to produce new combination of genes.

## Key Characteristics
- Involves transfer of DNA segments from one organism to another
- Uses DNA recombinant technology as the primary method
- Enables biologists to recombine DNA or genome (complete set of DNA) of organisms
- Creates new genotypes that ultimately lead to production of organisms with desired traits

## Primary Functions
- Produce beneficial gene combinations not found naturally
- Transfer useful genes between different species
- Create organisms with enhanced or novel properties
- Develop solutions to human problems through genetic manipulation

âœ… **Quick Check**: How does genetic engineering differ from natural breeding methods?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Think of genetic engineering like being able to copy and paste specific sentences from different books to create a new story with exactly the traits you want, rather than waiting for those sentences to appear naturally through random processes.
