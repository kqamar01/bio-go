# Genetically Modified Food (GMF) <sub>[28.1.2]</sub>

## What is it?
Genetically modified food (GMF) possesses DNA from other species of plant or animal, created through recombinant DNA technology.

## Key Characteristics
- Contains genetic material from different species
- Produced using recombinant DNA technology
- Includes both crops and livestock varieties
- May have unknown health implications for human consumption
- Designed to possess specific beneficial traits

## Primary Functions
- Address worldwide food shortages through improved varieties
- Enhance nutritional value of crops
- Increase resistance to pests, diseases, and environmental stresses
- Reduce agricultural production costs
- Provide medical applications through food sources

## Enhanced Traits in GMF
- **Resistance to pests**: Built-in protection against insect damage
- **Resistance to herbicides**: Allows targeted weed control without crop damage
- **Resistance to diseases**: Protection against viral, bacterial, or fungal infections
- **Tolerance to heavy metals**: Ability to grow in contaminated soils
- **Medical applications**: Production of pharmaceuticals or therapeutic compounds

## Examples

### Bt Corn
Corn engineered with genes from Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria produces natural insecticides that protect against insect pests, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.

### Super Salmon
Atlantic salmon modified with growth hormone genes from Chinook salmon grows at a faster rate and can be produced throughout the year, approved for safe consumption in the United States and Canada.

### Cold-Resistant Potatoes
Potatoes modified with freezing tolerance genes from Arabidopsis plants can thrive in cold climates where regular potatoes would suffer frost damage.

âœ… **Quick Check**: What distinguishes GMF from traditionally bred food varieties?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Link**: GMF represents a technological approach to addressing global food security challenges, though it requires careful evaluation of both benefits and potential risks.
