# Biotechnology Definition and Classifications <sub>[28.2.1]</sub>

## What is it?
Biotechnology is a field that utilizes technology or methods to manipulate organisms for the production of biological products.

## Key Characteristics
- Integrates multiple scientific disciplines for practical applications
- Focuses on using living organisms for specific purposes
- Aims to improve quality of livestock and crops
- Develops applications of microorganisms for targeted goals
- Each discipline receives a specific color code classification

## Primary Functions
- Improve agricultural products and livestock quality
- Develop medical treatments and diagnostics
- Create environmental solutions for pollution control
- Produce industrial compounds using biological processes
- Advance scientific research through biotechnological tools

## Classification by Color Codes

### Major Categories
- **Green Biotechnology**: Improving agricultural products
- **White Biotechnology**: Industrial processes involving microorganisms
- **Yellow Biotechnology**: Food and nutrition applications
- **Blue Biotechnology**: Marine biotechnology applications

### Specialized Fields
- **Red Biotechnology**: Medicine and human health
- **Grey Biotechnology**: Environmental biotechnology
- **Brown Biotechnology**: Biotechnology of desert and dry regions
- **Gold Biotechnology**: Bioinformatics and computer science
- **Purple Biotechnology**: Law, ethics and philosophy
- **Dark Biotechnology**: Bioterrorism and biological warfare

## Applications Across Disciplines
The multidisciplinary nature of biotechnology allows it to address challenges in agriculture, medicine, environmental protection, and industrial production through the strategic use of biological systems and organisms.

âœ… **Quick Check**: How does the color-coding system help organize biotechnology applications?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Think of biotechnology as a master toolkit where different colored tools (disciplines) are specialized for different jobs, but they all work together to solve problems using the power of living organisms.
