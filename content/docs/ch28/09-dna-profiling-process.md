# DNA Profiling Process <sub>[28.2.2]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
To create a unique DNA fingerprint from biological samples that can be used for individual identification in forensic investigations.

## The Breakdown
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: Sample Collection and DNA Extraction
A blood, semen, or skin sample is obtained from an investigation scene (such as a crime scene). DNA is then extracted from the cellular material in the sample.

### Step 2: DNA Fragmentation
Restriction enzymes cut the extracted DNA into different sizes of DNA fragments. These fragments vary in length due to individual genetic differences.

### Step 3: Fragment Separation
The DNA fragments of different sizes are separated using gel electrophoresis, which sorts them by size with smaller fragments moving further through the gel.

### Step 4: Transfer and Detection
The separated DNA fragments are transferred from the gel to a nylon membrane. Radioactive probes are then added to the membrane to bind to specific DNA sequences.

### Step 5: Profile Visualization
An X-ray film is placed on top of the nylon membrane and exposed to radiation from the probes. The film is then processed to reveal the positions of DNA bands.

### Step 6: Pattern Analysis
The developed X-ray film shows a distinctive pattern of dark bands that forms the unique DNA profile for that individual.

## Pattern Interpretation
Each DNA profile appears as a series of dark bands at different positions. The pattern of band positions is unique to each individual (except identical twins) and can be compared between samples to determine if they came from the same person.

## Quality Control Factors
- **Sample Integrity**: DNA must be well-preserved for accurate analysis
- **Contamination Prevention**: Samples must be collected and handled properly
- **Technical Precision**: Laboratory procedures must follow strict protocols
- **Chain of Custody**: Proper documentation ensures legal admissibility
