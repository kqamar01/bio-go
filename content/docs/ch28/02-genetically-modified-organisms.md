# Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) <sub>[28.1.1]</sub>

## What is it?
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organisms that contain recombinant DNA produced through genetic engineering techniques.

## Key Characteristics
- Contain recombinant DNA from genetic engineering processes
- Also known as transgenic organisms
- Can be animals, plants, or microorganisms
- Possess new gene combinations not found naturally
- Created using recombinant DNA technology

## Primary Functions
- Serve as living factories for producing desired proteins or compounds
- Provide enhanced traits like disease resistance or improved nutrition
- Act as research models for studying gene function
- Offer solutions to agricultural, medical, and environmental challenges

## Examples

### Medical Applications
A genetically modified cow produces milk that does not contain Î²-lactoglobulin, a protein known to cause allergies in some children. This modification makes the milk safer for consumption by allergic individuals.

A genetically modified goat possesses a human gene coding for a blood clotting factor. This blood coagulation factor is found in the goat's milk and can be purified for use in treating hemophilic patients.

### Agricultural Applications
Genetically modified corn contains genes that make it resistant to insect pests, reducing the need for chemical pesticides while maintaining crop yields.

ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: GMOs are like cars that have been fitted with parts from different manufacturers to create a vehicle with specific desired features that wouldn't occur naturally in any single car model.
