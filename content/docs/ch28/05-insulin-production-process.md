# Production of Insulin by Genetic Engineering <sub>[28.1.2]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
To produce large quantities of human insulin using genetically modified bacteria for treating diabetes mellitus patients, replacing the previous method of extracting insulin from cattle or pig pancreases.

## The Breakdown
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: Plasmid Preparation
A bacterium contains a plasmid (circular DNA found in bacteria used as a cloning vector), which is cut using restriction enzymes to create openings for gene insertion.

### Step 2: Human Gene Isolation
Normal human DNA containing the insulin gene is isolated from pancreatic cells and cut with the same restriction enzymes to ensure compatible ends.

### Step 3: Gene Insertion
The human insulin gene is inserted into the cut plasmid using DNA ligase enzyme, creating a recombinant plasmid that contains both bacterial and human genetic material.

### Step 4: Bacterial Transformation
The recombinant plasmid is introduced into a bacterium, creating a transgenic bacterium capable of producing human insulin.

### Step 5: Bacterial Multiplication
The transgenic bacterium is cultured in large quantities, with each bacterial clone multiplying rapidly and producing human insulin.

### Step 6: Insulin Extraction
Insulin is extracted from the transgenic bacteria and purified for medical use, ensuring it meets pharmaceutical standards for treating diabetes patients.

## Key Advantages of This Method
- **Pure Human Insulin**: Produces identical insulin to what humans naturally make
- **Large-Scale Production**: Bacteria multiply rapidly, enabling mass production
- **Consistent Quality**: Controlled manufacturing ensures reliable insulin supply
- **Reduced Allergic Reactions**: Human insulin causes fewer immune responses than animal-derived insulin
- **Cost-Effective**: More economical than extracting from animal pancreases

## Other Medical Successes
Beyond insulin, genetic engineering has successfully produced other crucial medical products including hepatitis B vaccine, blood clotting factors, and growth hormone.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why is bacterial-produced human insulin superior to insulin extracted from cattle or pigs?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Link**: This breakthrough has revolutionized diabetes treatment, providing millions of patients worldwide with a reliable, safe, and effective source of insulin that closely matches their body's natural hormone.
