# DNA Profiling <sub>[28.2.2]</sub>

## What is it?
DNA profiling is a forensic technique used to identify individuals based on their unique DNA sequences.

## Key Characteristics
- Based on the fact that individual DNA is unique (except for identical twins)
- Human DNA is distinct from animal DNA
- Can be performed using blood, semen, or skin samples
- Produces a distinctive pattern of DNA bands unique to each person
- Invented by Sir Alec Jeffreys at Leicester University in 1985

## Primary Functions
- Identify criminals in forensic investigations
- Identify genetic diseases and inherited conditions
- Settle paternity and maternity disputes
- Determine suitability of organ donors and recipients
- Support legal proceedings with scientific evidence

## Historical Significance
Sir Alec Jeffreys developed the DNA profiling technique in 1985 and was awarded the Copley Medal, the oldest scientific award predating the Nobel Prize, for this groundbreaking achievement.

## Legal Requirements
For DNA profiling to serve as strong evidence in criminal cases, several conditions must be met:
- Biological samples must be obtained and processed correctly and consensually
- Forensic scientists must test and analyze samples meticulously in a transparent manner
- Test results must be interpreted precisely
- Jury and judge must receive accurate, understandable reports

## Sample Sources
DNA can be extracted from various biological materials found at crime scenes:
- **Blood**: Most common source for DNA analysis
- **Semen**: Useful in sexual assault cases
- **Skin cells**: Found on touched objects or under fingernails
- **Saliva**: Present on items that have been licked or bitten

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why can't DNA profiling distinguish between identical twins?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Application**: DNA profiling has revolutionized criminal justice, helping to convict guilty parties and exonerate innocent individuals, while also reuniting families and solving paternity disputes with unprecedented accuracy.
