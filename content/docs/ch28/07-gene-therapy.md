# Gene Therapy <sub>[28.2.2]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
To treat genetic diseases by replacing abnormal genes with normal, functional genes that can restore proper cellular function.

## The Breakdown
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: Disease Identification
A cell containing an abnormal gene is identified as the source of genetic disease, causing improper protein production or cellular dysfunction.

### Step 2: Gene Replacement
A normal gene is prepared for insertion to replace the abnormal gene, typically using a virus as a delivery vector to transport the therapeutic gene into target cells.

### Step 3: Cellular Restoration
The cell now contains the normal gene and can perform its intended functions properly, potentially curing or treating the genetic disease.

## Key Applications
- **Inherited Diseases**: Treatment of single-gene disorders
- **Cancer Therapy**: Introduction of tumor-suppressor genes
- **Immune Deficiencies**: Restoration of immune system function
- **Metabolic Disorders**: Correction of enzyme deficiencies

## CRISPR Technology
Active research continues using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) technology for precise genome editing during gene therapy. This advanced technique allows for targeted modification of specific DNA sequences with unprecedented accuracy.

## Historical Milestone
The first successful gene therapy was performed in 1990 on Ashanti DeSilva, a patient with ADA-SCID, a genetic disease that interfered with her immune system function.

## Delivery Methods
- **Viral Vectors**: Modified viruses carry therapeutic genes into cells
- **Direct Injection**: Physical delivery of genes into specific tissues
- **Electroporation**: Electric pulses create temporary cell membrane openings
- **Liposome Carriers**: Lipid-based particles transport genetic material

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why are viruses commonly used as vectors in gene therapy?
ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Application**: Gene therapy represents a promising frontier for treating previously incurable genetic diseases, offering hope for patients with conditions like sickle cell disease, muscular dystrophy, and certain forms of blindness.
