# Comparing Anabolism and Catabolism <sub>[5.1.2]</sub>

## What do they have in common?
Both anabolism and catabolism are essential metabolic processes that work together to maintain life by managing energy and building materials within cells.

## Key Differences at a Glance
| Feature                | Anabolism                | Catabolism                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Purpose** | Building complex molecules from simple ones | Breaking down complex substances into simple ones |
| **Energy** | Uses/absorbs energy | Releases energy |
| **Example Process** | Glucose formation during photosynthesis | Glucose breakdown during cellular respiration |
| **General Reaction** | A + B â†’ C | A â†’ B + C |

âœ… **Quick Check**: What is the main functional difference between anabolism and catabolism in terms of energy?
ðŸ’¡ **Why it Matters**: Understanding this difference is critical for comprehending how your body both stores energy (anabolism) and releases it when needed (catabolism) during exercise or fasting.
