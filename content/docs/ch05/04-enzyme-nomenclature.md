# Enzyme Nomenclature System <sub>[5.2.3]</sub>

## What is it?
The systematic naming of enzymes based on their substrate or the reaction they catalyze, established by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB).

## Key Characteristics
- Name derived by adding '-ase' to the substrate name
- Introduced in the 1960s for standardization
- Indicates the enzyme's function through its name
- Replaces older, non-systematic names

## Primary Functions
- Provides clear identification of enzyme function
- Creates international standardization
- Facilitates scientific communication
- Links enzyme name directly to its substrate

**Examples of Systematic Naming:**
- **Lactase** - catalyzes hydrolysis of lactose
- **Amylase** - breaks down starch (amylum)
- **Lipase** - breaks down lipids

**Historical Exceptions:**
- Trypsin, pepsin, and renin (named before systematic naming)

âœ… **Quick Check**: What would you call an enzyme that breaks down cellulose?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: It's like naming tools based on their function - a "can opener" opens cans, just like "lactase" breaks down lactose.
