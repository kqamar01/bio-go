## What is it? <sub>[5.1.1]</sub>
Metabolism refers to all chemical reactions that occur in a living organism.

## Key Characteristics
- Involves conversion of food into energy in the form of ATP
- Includes formation of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids
- Encompasses all biochemical processes necessary for life
- Occurs continuously in living cells

## Primary Functions
- Energy production through ATP synthesis
- Building complex molecules from simple precursors
- Breaking down complex substances for energy release
- Maintaining cellular homeostasis
