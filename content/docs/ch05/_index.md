* **Fundamental Biochemical Processes**: An overview of metabolism, including anabolic and catabolic reactions for energy production and biomolecule synthesis.
* **Enzymes**:
    * **Function**: Biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions without being used up.
    * **Mechanism**: Explores the "lock and key" hypothesis and the role of activation energy.
    * **Factors Affecting Activity**: Details how temperature, pH, substrate concentration, and enzyme concentration influence enzyme function.
    * **Practical Investigations**: Uses amylase and pepsin as examples to support experimental investigations.
* **Applications of Enzymes**: Highlights their use in everyday life and industry, such as in digestion, food processing, and bio-detergents.
* **Immobilized Enzyme Technology**: Focuses on the application of enzymes in leather production and other industrial processes.
