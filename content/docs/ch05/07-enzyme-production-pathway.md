# The Process of Extracellular Enzyme Production <sub>[5.2.5-2]</sub>

## What's the Goal?
To produce and secrete functional enzymes outside the cell where they can catalyze reactions in external environments, such as digestive enzymes breaking down food in the intestine.

## The Breakdown
{{% steps %}}
### Step 1: Protein Synthesis
Ribosomes attached to rough endoplasmic reticulum synthesize proteins, which enter the ER lumen and are transported through it.

### Step 2: Vesicle Formation
At the end of the rough ER, the membrane buds off to form transport vesicles containing the proteins.

### Step 3: Transport to Golgi
Transport vesicles move toward the Golgi apparatus and fuse with it, delivering their protein cargo.

### Step 4: Protein Modification
In the Golgi apparatus, proteins are modified into functional enzymes and packaged into secretory vesicles formed from Golgi tips.

### Step 5: Secretion
Secretory vesicles move to the plasma membrane, fuse with it, and release the extracellular enzymes outside the cell.
