# General Properties of Enzymes <sub>[5.2.4]</sub>

## What is it?
The fundamental characteristics that define how enzymes function as biological catalysts in living organisms.

## Key Characteristics
- **Specificity**: Only substrates that fit completely with the active site can combine
- **Reusability**: Required in small quantities and remain unchanged after reactions
- **Reversibility**: Most enzyme-catalyzed reactions can proceed in both directions
- **Speed**: Act rapidly to accelerate biochemical reactions

## Primary Functions
- Catalyze specific biochemical reactions with precision
- Lower activation energy requirements
- Enable rapid cellular processes
- Maintain structural integrity throughout reactions

**Additional Properties:**
- Can be inhibited by heavy metals (lead, mercury)
- Some require cofactors (vitamin B, magnesium ions) for optimal function
- Structure remains unchanged after catalysis
- Function as biological catalysts

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why can one enzyme molecule catalyze thousands of reactions?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Enzymes work like a specialized key that can unlock the same door thousands of times - they facilitate the reaction but emerge unchanged, ready to work again.
