# Comparing Intracellular and Extracellular Enzymes <sub>[5.2.5-1]</sub>

## What do they have in common?
Both types of enzymes are synthesized by cells to catalyze specific biochemical reactions, but they differ in their location of action and method of delivery.

## Key Differences at a Glance
| Feature                | Intracellular Enzymes                | Extracellular Enzymes                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Location** | Function within the cell that produced them | Secreted outside the producing cell |
| **Purpose** | Used by the cell for its own metabolic needs | Used to process materials external to the cell |
| **Example** | Hexokinase (used in glycolysis) | Trypsin (secreted into duodenum) |
| **Transport** | Remain in cytoplasm or organelles | Transported via secretory vesicles |

âœ… **Quick Check**: Where would you expect to find digestive enzymes - intracellular or extracellular?
ðŸ’¡ **Why it Matters**: This distinction is crucial for understanding digestion - your pancreas makes enzymes (intracellular production) but secretes them into your intestine (extracellular action) to break down food.
