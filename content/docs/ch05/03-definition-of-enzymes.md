# Definition and Role of Enzymes <sub>[5.2.1-5.2.2]</sub>

## What is it?
An enzyme is an organic catalyst that is mostly made up of proteins and is produced by living cell organisms.

## Key Characteristics
- Speed up biochemical reactions without being consumed
- Have specific binding sites called active sites
- Form enzyme-substrate complexes during reactions
- Most are proteins (though some are made from RNA)
- Required in small quantities and are reusable

## Primary Functions
- Accelerate biochemical reactions by lowering activation energy
- Enable metabolic processes to occur at rates compatible with life
- Facilitate substrate conversion to products
- Maintain cellular reaction specificity

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why are enzymes essential for life processes?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Enzymes are like skilled workers on an assembly line - they speed up production without being used up in the process, and each has a specific job they're perfectly designed to do.
