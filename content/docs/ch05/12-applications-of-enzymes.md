## What is it?
The widespread commercial and everyday use of enzymes extracted from natural sources or produced synthetically to improve industrial processes and consumer products.

## Key Characteristics
- Extracted from bacteria, fungi, or other natural sources
- Can be produced synthetically for specific applications
- Often used as immobilized enzymes for increased stability
- Provide eco-friendly alternatives to harsh chemical processes

## Primary Functions
- **Medical Sector**: Digestive enzymes aid digestion in patients
- **Food Industry**: Pectinase and cellulase extract more juice from fruits
- **Dairy Industry**: Lactase produces lactose-free milk
- **Textile Industry**: Protease separates fish skin and animal fur
- **Cleaning Industry**: Multiple enzymes in bio-detergents break down stains

**Immobilized Enzyme Technology:**
Enzymes combined with inert, insoluble substances to increase resistance to pH and temperature changes, allowing easy separation from products and reuse.

âœ… **Quick Check**: Why are enzyme-based detergents considered more environmentally friendly?
ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: Enzymes in industry work like specialized cleaning crews - each type tackles specific problems (proteins, fats, starches) more efficiently and gently than harsh chemical "bulldozers."
